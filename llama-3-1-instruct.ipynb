The whole world\nhaving faced adverse effect of different kinds of\ndisasters is now well aware of its ill effect and\nsteps internationally as well as nationally are being\ntaken for last several decades to combat different\n3\nkinds of disasters. U.N. General Assembly\nrecognizing the importance of reducing the impact of\nnatural disaster for all people including developing\ncountries designated 1990 as the international decade\nof natural disaster reduction. The International\nStrategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR) was\nestablished following IDNDR of the 1990s. The UN/GA\nconvened the second World Conference on Disaster Risk\nReduction (DRR) in Kobe, Hyogo, Japan 2005, which\nconcluded the review of the Yokohama Strategy and its\nPlan of Action and the adoption of the Hyogo\nFramework for Action 2005–2015: Building the\nResilience of Nations and Communities to Disasters\n(HFA) (UNISDR 2005) by 168 countries. The HFA\noutlined five priorities for action: \n“(1) Ensure that DRR is a national and a\nlocal priority with a strong\ninstitutional\nfor\nimplementation; \nbasis\n \n \n(2) Identify, assess, and monitor disaster\nrisks and enhance early warning; \n4\n(3) Use knowledge, innovation, and\neducation to build a culture of safety\nand resilience at all levels; \n(4) Reduce the underlying risk factors; \n(5) Strengthen disaster preparedness for\neffective response at all levels.”\n</para>\n<para>\n3. On 23.12.2005, both the Houses of Indian Parliament\npassed a Disaster Management Bill. The Introduction\nand the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Bill\nmentions: -\n“INTRODUCTION\nFor prevention and mitigation effects\nof disasters and for undertaking a\nholistic, coordinated and prompt response\nto any disaster situation it has been\ndecided by the Government to enact a law\non disaster management to provide for\nrequisite institutional mechanisms for\ndrawing up and monitoring the\nimplementation of the disaster management\nplans, ensuring measures by various wings\nof Government. To achieve this objective\nthe Disaster Management Bill was\nintroduced in the Parliament. \nSTATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS \nThe Government have decided to enact a\nlaw on disaster management to provide for\nrequisite institutional mechanisms for\ndrawing up and monitoring the\n5\nimplementation of the disaster management\nplans, ensuring measures by various wings\nof Government for prevention and\nmitigating effects of disasters and for\nundertaking a holistic, coordinated and\nprompt response to any disaster\nsituation.”\n</para>\n<para>\n4.\nThe Disaster Management Act, 2005 (hereinafter\nreferred to as “Act, 2005”) was enacted to provide\nfor the effective management of disasters and\nmatters connected therewith or incidental thereto.\nThe enactment of Disaster Management Act, 2005 was\nto bring in place requisite institutional\nmechanisms for drawing up and monitoring the\nimplementation of the Disaster Management Plans\nand other measures by various wings of the\nGovernment for preventing and mitigating effects\nof disasters. We shall notice the relevant\nprovisions of the Act a little later. \n</para>\n<para>\n5. In accord with Disaster Management Act, 2005, Union\nCabinet approved a “National Policy on Disaster\nManagement, 2009”. Paragraph 1.1.1, 1.2.1 and 1.3.1\nof the policy reads as under: - \n6\n“1.1.1 Disasters disrupt progress and\ndestroy the hard-earned fruits of\npainstaking developmental efforts, often\npushing nations, in quest for progress,\nback by several decades. Thus, efficient\nmanagement of disasters, rather than mere\nresponse to their occurrence, has in\nrecent times, received increased attention\nboth within India and abroad. This is as\nmuch a result of the recognition of the\nincreasing frequency and intensity of\ndisasters, as it is an acknowledgement\nthat good governance in a caring and\ncivilised society, needs to deal\neffectively with the devastating impact of\ndisasters. \n1.2.1 India is vulnerable, in varying\ndegrees, to a large number of natural as\nwell as man-made disasters. 58.6 per cent\nof the landmass is prone to earthquakes of\nmoderate to very high intensity; over 40\nmillion hectares (12 per cent of land) is\nprone to floods and river erosion; of the\n7,516 km long coastline, close to 5,700 km\nis prone to cyclones and tsunamis; 68 per\ncent of the cultivable area is vulnerable\nto drought and hilly areas are at risk\nfrom landslides and avalanches.\nVulnerability to disasters/emergencies of\nChemical, Biological, Radiological and\nNuclear (CBRN) origin also exists.\nHeightened vulnerabilities to disaster\nrisks can be related to expanding\npopulation,\nand\nindustrialisation, development within\nurbanisation\n \n \nhigh-risk zones, environmental degradation\nand climate change (Maps 1–4). \n7\n1.3.1 On 23 December 2005, the Government\nof India (GoI) took a defining step by\nenacting the Disaster Management Act,\n2005, (hereinafter referred to as the Act)\nwhich envisaged the creation of the\nNational Disaster Management Authority\n(NDMA), headed by the Prime Minister,\nState Disaster Management Authorities\n(SDMAs) headed by the Chief Ministers, and\nDistrict Disaster Management Authorities\n(DDMAs) headed by the District Collector\nor District Magistrate or Deputy\nCommissioner as the case may be, to\nspearhead and adopt a holistic and\nintegrated approach to DM. There will be a\nparadigm shift, from the erstwhile relief-\ncentric response to a proactive\nprevention, mitigation and preparedness-\ndriven\nconserving\ndevelopmental gains and to minimise loss\nof life, livelihood and property.”\napproach\n \n \nfor\n \nThe policy noticed institutional framework under\nthe Act, dealt with financial arrangement, disaster\nprevention, mitigation and preparedness. \n</para>\n<para>\n6. Third U.N. World Conference on Disaster Risk\nReduction was held in March, 2015 at Sendai, Japan.\nOne of the declarations made in the conference was: -\n8\n“We, the Heads of State and Government,\nministers and delegates participating in\nthe Third United Nations World Conference\non Disaster Risk Reduction, have gathered\nfrom 14 to 18 March 2015 in Sendai City of\nMiyagi Prefecture in Japan, which has\ndemonstrated a vibrant recovery from the\nGreat East Japan Earthquake in March 2011.\nRecognizing the increasing impact of\ndisasters and their complexity in many\nparts of the world, we declare our\ndetermination to enhance our efforts to\nstrengthen disaster risk reduction to\nreduce disaster losses of lives and assets\nfrom\n \nworldwide.”\n \ndisasters\n \n</para>\n<para>\n7. The Sendai declaration dealing with priorities for\naction emphasized following in paragraph 33(a):-\n”33(a) To prepare or review and\nperiodically update disaster\npreparedness and contingency\npolicies, plans and programmes with\nthe involvement of the relevant\ninstitutions, considering climate\nchange scenarios and their impact\non disaster risk, and facilitating,\nas appropriate, the participation\nof all sectors and relevant\nstakeholders;”\n</para>\n<para>\n8. Although Section 11 of Act, 2005 contemplated\npreparation of a National Plan, however, the National\nPlan was not prepared till the year 2016 as was\n9\nnoticed by this Court in a judgment of this Court in\nSwaraj Abhiyan Vs. Union of India & Ors., (2016) 7\nSCC 498. In the year 2016, National Disaster\nManagement Plan was prepared as required by Section\n11 of the Act, 2005. The \npreparation of the\nNational Plan under Section 11 was noticed by this\nCourt in Gaurav Kumar Bansal Vs. Union of India and\nOrs., (2017) 6 SCC 730. In the same judgment, this\nCourt noticed that State Plan under Section 23 of the\nAct (except by two States) and District Plan have\nalso been prepared. The preparation of National\nPlan, State Plan and District Plan were noticed in\nparagraphs 7, 11 and 12 of the above judgment, which\nare to the following effect:-\n“7. It was further pointed out that a\nNational Plan has been approved and placed\non the website of the NDMA in terms of\nSection 11 of the Act and the guidelines\nfor minimum standards of relief Under\nSection 12 of the Act have also been\nplaced on the website of the NDMA.\n11. As far as the preparation of the State\nPlan Under Section 23 of the Act is\nconcerned, we have been informed by the\nlearned Counsel for NDMA that all States\n10\nexcept Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have\nprepared a State Disaster Management Plan\nwhich is very much in place.\n12. As far as the districts are concerned,\nit is stated that the District Disaster\nManagement Authority has been constituted\nin every district Under Section 25 of the\nAct and out of 684 districts in the\ncountry, a District Disaster Management\nPlan is in place in 615 districts while it\nis under process in the remaining\ndistricts.”\n</para>\n<para>\n9.\nThe revision of the existing National Disaster\nManagement Plan, 2016 began in April, 2017 and\ncompleted in November, 2019.

We have also heard Shri Tushar Mehta,\nlearned Solicitor General appearing for the Union of\nIndia. \n12.\nPetitioner’s case in the writ petition is that\nthe National Plan uploaded on the website of National\nDisaster Management Authority of the year 2019 does\nnot deal with situations arising out of the current\n13\npandemic and has no mention of measures like\nlockdown, containment zones, social distancing etc.\nThe Central Government has notified COVID-19 as a\n“disaster” under Act, 2005 and has issued series of\nnotifications to contain the instant pandemic.\nPetitioner pleads that Centre need to prepare a well-\ndrawn National Plan to deal with instant pandemic and\nthe same need to be prepared after due consultation\nwith the State Government and experts. Petitioner\nfurther pleads that Centre should come up with\ndetailed guidelines recommending the minimum\nstandards of relief to be provided in the relief\ncamps in relation to shelter, food, drinking water,\nmedical cover and sanitation, in absence of which,\nshelter homes and relief camps are susceptible of\nbecoming hotbeds for the spread of COVID-19\ninfection. Petitioner pleads that Centre should come\nup with detailed guidelines under Section 12(ii) and\n(iii) of the Act, 2005 recommending special\nprovisions to be made for widows and orphans and ex\ngratia to be provided to the kith and kin of those\nlosing life not just because of COVID-19 infection\nbut also due to harsh lockdown restrictions. \n14\n</para>\n<para>\n13.\nThe petitioner’s case further is that the\ngrants/contributions by individuals and institutions\nshould be credited into the National Disaster\nResponse Fund (NDRF) under Section 46 of the Act,\n2005 and NDRF should be utilized for meeting the\nongoing COVID-19 crisis. All the contributions made\nby the individuals and institutions in relation to\nCOVID-19 are being credited into the PM CARES Fund\nand not in NDRF, which is clear violation of Section\n46 of the Act, 2005. The NDRF is subject to CAG\nAudit and PM CARES Fund is not subject to CAG Audit.\nPetitioner’s case further is that the Centre may be\ndirected to utilize NDRF for the purpose of drawing\nassistance to fight against COVID-19 and all the\ncontributions/grants\n \nfrom\n \nindividuals\n \nand\ninstitutions be credited to the NDRF in terms of\n15\nSection 46(1)(b) rather than to PM CARES Fund and all\nthe Fund Collected in the PM CARES Fund till date may\nbe directed to be transferred to the NDRF.\n</para>\n<para>\n14.\nA preliminary counter affidavit has been filed on\nbehalf of the Union of India. In the counter\naffidavit, the respondents have questioned the locus\nof the petitioner to file this public interest\nlitigation. Counter affidavit questions as to\nwhether there can be a permanent body set up only to\nfile litigation on issues, which the said body\nsubjectively considers to be of “public interest”.\nCounter affidavit pleads that National Disaster\nManagement Plan as per Section 11 is already in place\nand relevant portion of National Disaster Management\nPlan – November, 2019 has been annexed as Annexure R-\n1 to the counter affidavit. Counter affidavit pleads\nthat Act, 2005 provides for a broad framework in\nterms of the response to be provided in pursuance to\na National Plan in case of any disaster. Counter\naffidavit pleads that National Plan does not and\n16\ncannot contain step by step instructions or specific\ninstructions for the day to day management by\nGovernment agencies in the situation of any\nparticular and unforeseen disaster. National Plan is\nnot a document that contains the microscopic details\nas to the day to day management of the issues arising\nout of different disasters. National Disaster\nManagement Authority has issued various orders from\ntime to time to take effective measures found\nrequired at the relevant point of time to contain the\nspread of COVID-19 in the country. The Chairperson\nof National Executive Committee has issued several\nguidelines from time to time. National Disaster\nManagement Authority has, in order to create\npreparedness with regard to any contingent biological\ndisaster, has framed the “National Disaster\nManagement Guidelines Management of Biological\nDisasters”. National Disaster Management Authority\nhas framed broad template for State level and\nDistrict level for contingency plan for COVID-19.\n</para>\n<para>\n17\nThe Nodal Ministry, i.e., Ministry of Health and\nFamily Welfare has issued a “Cluster Containment Plan\nfor COVID-19” on 02.03.2020, which was further\nupdated on 16.05.2020. Further instructions have\nbeen issued from time to time including the guidance\ndocuments. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare\nhas approved the India COVID-19 Emergency Response\nand Health Systems Preparedness Package of Rs.15000\ncrores, which seeks to support States/Union\nTerritories in various aspects of management of the\nCOVID Pandemic and provides support for establishment\nof COVID dedicated facilities for treatment of COVID-\n19 cases including for critical care, enhancement in\ntesting capacities, engagement and training of\nnecessary human resources and procurement of\nessential equipment and protective gear for the\nhealth care personnel engaged in COVID-19 duties etc.\nWith regard to minimum standards of relief, the\ncounter affidavit refers and relies on guidelines on\nMinimum Standards of Relief under Section 12, which\n18\nhas been brought on record as Annexure R-7. The\nCounter affidavit also outlines various steps taken\nby Health Ministry as well as the Government of\nIndia. \n</para>\n<para>\n15.\nReplying the averments in the writ petition\nregarding PM CARES Fund and NDRF, the counter\naffidavit pleads that there are several funds which\nare either established earlier or now for carrying\nout various relief works. PM CARES Fund is one of\nsuch funds with voluntary donations. Affidavit\nfurther states that there exist a NDRF which would\nnot prohibit creation of a different fund like PM\nCARES fund which provides for voluntary donations.\nThe directions prayed in the writ petition for\ntransfer of funds received in PM CARES Fund in the\nNDRF are non-maintainable. \n</para>\n<para>\n16.\nShri Dushyant Dave, learned senior counsel\nappearing for the petitioner referring to the\npleadings of the petitioner made in the writ petition\n19\ncontends that Centre was obliged to prepare a\nNational Plan for Disaster Management specifically\nfor COVID-19. Shri Dave does not dispute that\nNational Plan under Section 11 has been framed in\nNovember, 2019 but he submits that said Plan is\nneither comprehensive nor covers management of\npandemic, i.e., COVID-19. Shri Dave submits that\npower given in a Statute is to be exercised in the\nsame manner. Shri Dave further submits that there is\na serious problem in implementing the National Plan,\n2019. Shri Dave has taken us to certain portion of\nPlan of November, 2019, which has been filed as\nAnnexure – P-2 to the writ petition. Shri Dave\nsubmits that only paragraph 7.15 deals with\nbiological and public health emergencies but Plan\ndoes not contemplate giving any financial relief.\nShri Dave submits that unless there is a National\nPlan for COVID-19, effective measures cannot be taken\nto contain COVID-19. Referring to Section 46 of the\nAct, 2005, Shri Dave submits that NDRF having been\n20\nconstituted by Central Government, all amount given\nby individuals and organisations for disaster should\nhave been credited in NDRF. He submits that PM CARES\nFund should not have been constituted when NDRF is\nalready in place to take care of disasters. Shri\nDave submits that there is no provision in 2019 Plan\nto give fund to NDRF. Referring to Operational\nGuidelines for Constitution and Administration of the\nNational Disaster Response Fund at page 129 of the\nwrit petition, Shri Dave submits that paragraph 5.5\nprovides that contribution made by the persons or\ninstitutions for the purpose of disaster management\nto be credited in the NDRF, which clause 5.5 has been\nomitted in the subsequent Operational Guidelines for\nConstitution and Administration of the National\nDisaster Response Fund filed at page 154, which is\nrecent guidelines. By deletion of clause 5.5 now\ncontribution by any person or institution for the\npurpose of disaster management to the NDRF is not\npermissible. Shri Dave submits that petitioners have\n21\nno reason to doubt the bonafide of PM CARES Fund but\nby creating PM CARES Fund the NDRF is being\ncircumvented. What cannot be done directly cannot be\ndone indirectly. Although, NDRF is audited by CAG,\nthe PM CARES Fund is audited by only private\nauditors. \n</para>\n<para>\n17. Shri Tushar Mehta, learned Solicitor General\nrefuting the submissions of the counsel for the\npetitioners submits that reliefs (i) and (ii) made in\nthe writ petition has become infructuous since\nNational Plan has already been prepared under Section\n11, which has been referred to in the counter\naffidavit and relevant extract of the Plan has\nalready been brought on record as Annexure R-1 along\nwith counter affidavit. He submits that insofar as\nthe guidelines for minimum standards of reliefs are\nconcerned, there are guidelines in existence, which\nhas been brought on record by the counter affidavit,\nwhich covers all disasters including COVID-19. Shri\n22\nMehta submits that Plan – November, 2019 along with\nthe powers given in the Act, 2005 contains several\nmeasures to contain the spread of COVID-19 and no\nseparate National Plan is required for COVID-19.\n</para>\n<para>\n18.\nShri Tushar Mehta submits that a National\nDisaster Response Fund has been created as stipulated\nunder Section 46 of Act, 2005, which consist of fund\nin the form of budgetary provisions made by the\nCentral Government in National Disaster Response\nFund. He submits that the existence of National\nDisaster Response Fund, which is a statutory fund,\nneither prevents creation of any public charitable\ntrust receiving voluntary donation nor can remotely\nmean that the amount received in all such voluntary\nfunds should go in the statutory fund created under\nSection 46. National Disaster Response Fund and PM\nCARES Fund being distinct and separate, there is no\noccasion for any direction to transfer the amount of\nPM CARES Fund to the National Disaster Response Fund.\n23\n</para>\n<para>\n19.\nWe have heard the learned counsel for the parties\nand perused the record. Applications for intervention\nare rejected.\n</para>\n<para>\n20.\nThe respondent in its affidavit has raised\ncontention/objection regarding the locus standi of\nthe petitioner. It is, inter alia, contended that\nthere cannot be a permanent body existing only for\nfiling public interest litigations. Shri Tushar\nMehta, learned Solicitor General, however, pointed\nout that at the outset, in the facts of the present\ncase, he would rather like to assist the Hon’ble\ncourt on merits and requested that the question of\nlocus standi of the petitioner which, according to\nhim is a very serious question, be left open to be\nraised and decided in other proceedings. We have,\ntherefore, heard the parties on merits, keeping the\naforesaid question open, to be heard and decided in\nan appropriate proceeding.\n24\n</para>\n<para>\n21.\nFrom the submissions of the learned counsel for\nthe parties and the pleadings on record, following\nquestions arise for consideration in this writ\npetition: -\nI) Whether the Union of India under Section 11 of\nAct, 2005, is obliged to prepare, notify and\nimplement a National Disaster Management Plan\nspecifically\n \nfor\n \npandemic\n \nCOVID-19\nirrespective of National Disaster Management\nPlan notified in November, 2019?\nII) Whether the Union of India is obliged to lay\ndown the minimum standards of relief under\nSection 12 of Act, 2005, for COVID-19\nirrespective of earlier guidelines issued\nunder Section 12 of the Act, 2005 laying down\nthe minimum standards of relief?\nIII) Whether Union of India is obliged to utilise\nNational Disaster Response Fund created under\n25\nSection 46 of the Act for the purpose of\nproviding assistance in the fight of COVID-19?\nIV) Whether all the contributions/grants from\nindividuals and institutions should be\ncredited to the NDRF in terms of Section 46(1)\n(b) of the Act rather than to PM CARES Fund?\nV) Whether all the funds collected in the PM CARES\nFund till date be directed to be transferred to\nthe NDRF?\nQUESTION NO.I\nI) Whether the Union of India under Section 11 of\nAct, 2005, is obliged to prepare, notify and\nimplement a National Disaster Management Plan\nspecifically for pandemic COVID-19 irrespective\nof National Disaster Management Plan notified in\nNovember, 2019?\n</para>\n<para>\n22.\nThe Act, 2005, has been enacted for the effective\nmanagement of Disasters and for matters connected\ntherewith or incidental thereto. Section 3 of the\nAct constitutes National Disaster Management\nAuthority with the Prime Minister of India as the\n26\nChairperson, ex-officio. Section 6 enumerates the\npowers and functions of National Authority. As per\nSection 6 sub-Section (2)(b), National Disaster\nManagement Authority (hereinafter referred to as\nNational Authority) is to approve the National Plan.\nUnder Section 7, the National Authority may\nconstitute an advisory Committee consisting of\nexperts in the field of Disaster Management to make\nrecommendations on different aspects of Disaster\nManagement. Under Section 8, the Central Government\nis to constitute a National Executive Committee to\nassist the National Authority in the performance of\nits functions under the Act. Section 11 of the Act\ndeals with National Plan, which provision is to the\nfollowing effect: -\n “11. National Plan –(1) There shall be\ndrawn up a plan for disaster management\nfor the whole of the country to be called\nthe National Plan. \n(2) The National Plan shall be\nprepared by the National Executive\nCommittee having regard to the National\nPolicy and in consultation with the State\nGovernments and expert bodies or\n27\norganizations in the field of disaster\nmanagement to be approved by the National\nAuthority.\n</para>\n<para>\n(3) The National Plan shall include – \n(a) measures to be taken for\nthe prevention of disasters,\nor the mitigation of their\neffects;\n(b) measures to be taken for\nthe integration of mitigation\nmeasures in the development\nplans;\n \n(c) measures to be taken for\npreparedness and capacity\nbuilding to effectively\nrespond to any threatening\ndisaster situations or\ndisaster; \n(d) roles and responsibilities\nof different Ministries or\nDepartments of the Government\nof India in respect of\nmeasures specified in clauses\n(a), (b) and (c). \n(4) The National Plan shall be\nreviewed and updated annually.\n(5) Appropriate provisions shall be\nmade by the Central Government for\nfinancing the measures to be carried out\nunder the National Plan. \n(6) Copies of the National Plan\nreferred to in sub-sections (2) and (4)\nshall be made available to the Ministries\nor Departments of the Government of India\n28\nand such Ministries or Departments shall\ndraw up their own plans in accordance with\nNational Plan.” \n23.\n \n</para>\n<para>\nAs noted above, the first National Plan under\nSection 11 was framed in the year 2016, which was\nrevised and the National Plan was prepared and\nnotified in November, 2019.

The Plan, 2019 under heading\n‘Executive Summary’ states: -\n“...The National Disaster Management\nPlan (NDMP) provides a framework and\ndirection to the government agencies for\nall phases of disaster management cycle.\nThe NDMP is a “dynamic document” in the\nsense that it will be periodically\nimproved keeping up with the emerging\nglobal best practices and knowledge base\n29\nin disaster management.

The Plan, 2019 provides a framework\nand directions to the Government Agencies for all\nphases of Disaster Management. The Plan is a dynamic\ndocument in the sense that it was to be periodically\nimproved, keeping up with the best practices and\nknowledge based in Disaster Management. The Plan\nprovides a framework covering all aspects of\nDisaster Management. It covers Disaster Risk\nReduction, mitigation, preparedness, response,\nrecovery and building back better. It recognizes\nthat effective Disaster Management necessitates a\ncomprehensive framework encompassing multiple\n30\nhazards. Paragraph 1.4 of the Plan under the heading\n‘Legal Mandate’ states: -\n“1.4. Legal Mandate\nSection 11 of the DM Act 2005 mandates\nthat there shall be a National Disaster\nManagement Plan (NDMP) for the whole of\nIndia. The NDMP complies with the National\nPolicy on Disaster Management (NPDM) of\n2009 and conforms to the provisions of the\nDM Act making it mandatory for the various\ncentral ministries and departments to have\nadequate DM plans. While the NDMP will\npertain to the disaster management for the\nwhole of the country, the hazard-specific\nnodal ministries and departments notified\nby the Government of India will prepare\ndetailed DM plans specific to the disaster\nassigned. As per Section 37 of the DM Act,\nevery ministry and department of the\nGovernment of India, be it hazard-specific\nnodal ministries or not, shall prepare\ncomprehensive DM plans detailing how each\nof them will contribute to the national\nefforts in the domains of disaster\nprevention, preparedness, response, and\nrecovery. \nAs per the mandate of the DM Act, the\nNDMP assigns specific and general\nresponsibilities to all ministries and\ndepartments for disaster management. The\nDM Act enjoins the NDMP to assign\nnecessary responsibilities to various\nministries to support and implement the\nplan. Therefore, it is incumbent on all\nministries to accept all the implicit and\nexplicit responsibilities mentioned in the\n31\nNDMP even if they are beyond what are\nexplicitly mentioned in the normal rules\nof business. Disaster management requires\nassumption of responsibilities beyond the\nnormal functioning. The NDMP will be\ncomplemented by separate contingency\nplans, SOPs, manuals, and guidelines at\nall levels of the multi-tiered governance\nsystem.”\n</para>\n<para>\n26.\nThe above part of the Plan categorically states\nthat the Plan will be complemented by several\ncontingency plans, Standard Operating Procedures\n(SOPs), Manuals and Guidelines at all levels of the\nmulti-tiered governance system. Paragraph 1.13 deals\nwith ‘types of Disasters’. Paragraph 1.13.1,\n‘Natural Hazards’ have been enumerated in five major\ncategories. Sub-category (5) is to the following\neffect:-\n“1.13.1 Natural Hazards\n1)...\n5)Biological Process or phenomenon\nor organic origin or conveyed by\nbiological vectors, including exposure\nto pathogenic micro-organisms, toxins\nand bioactive substances that may cause\nloss of life, injury, illness or other\nhealth impacts, property damage, loss\nof livelihoods and services, social and\n32\neconomic disruption or environmental\ndamage.”\n</para>\n<para>\n27.\nUnder Table 1-1, ‘Categories of Natural Hazards’\nhave been detailed.

Table 1-3, provides for ‘Nodal Ministry for\nManagement/Mitigation of Different Disasters’ with\nregard to Biological Emergencies, Nodal Ministry is\n33\nnotified as Ministry of Health and Family\nWelfare(MoHFW). Under paragraph 2.2.3.3, Biological\nand Public Health Emergencies have been dealt with. \nThe First paragraph of the above is as follows:-\n“...Disasters related to this sub-\ngroup are biological emergencies and\nepidemics, pest attacks, cattle epidemics\nand food poisoning. Biological emergency\nis one caused due to natural outbreaks of\nepidemics or intentional use of biological\nagents (viruses and microorganisms) or\ntoxins through dissemination of such\nagents in ways to harm human population,\nfood crops and livestock to cause\noutbreaks of diseases. This may happen\nthrough natural, accidental, or deliberate\ndispersal of such harmful agents into\nfood, water, air, soil or into plants,\ncrops, or livestock. Apart from the\nnatural transnational movement of the\npathogenic organisms, their potential use\nas weapons of biological warfare and\nbioterrorism has become far more important\nnow than ever before. Along with nuclear\nand chemical agents, many biological\nagents are now considered as capable of\ncausing large-scale mortality and\nmorbidity...”\n</para>\n<para>\n29.

Paragraph 7.15.3 deals\nwith investing in DRR – Structural measures.\nParagraph 7.15.4 deals with investing in DRR – Non-\nstructural measures. Paragraph 7.15.5 deals with\ncapacity development. Paragraph 7.15.6 deals with\nclimate change risk management. The plan, thus,\n38\ncontains detailed treatment of Biological and Public\nHealth Emergencies as noticed above, which have been\ndetailed at pages 117 to 130 of the Annexure-R1 of\nthe counter affidavit. All aspects of Biological and\nPublic Health Emergencies have been, thus, dealt in\nsystematic and planned manner. The Plan of 2019 in\ndifferent paragraphs deals with entire framework. \n</para>\n<para>\n33. The submission which has been pressed by\npetitioner is that despite existence of Plan, 2019,\nthere has to be specific Plan dealing with COVID-19,\nhence, Union of India may be directed to prepare a\nNational Plan under Section 11 for COVID-19. Section\n11 of the Act provides that there shall be a plan for\nDisaster Management for the whole of the Country.\nSub-Section (3) of Section 11 requires that the\nNational Plan shall include: -\n“11.(3) The National Plan shall include-\n(a) measures to be taken for the\nprevention of disasters, or the\nmitigation of their effects;\n39\n(b) measures to be taken for the\nintegration of mitigation measures\nin the development plans;\n \n(c) measures to be taken for\npreparedness and capacity building\nto effectively respond to any\nthreatening disaster situations or\ndisaster; \n(d) roles and responsibilities of\ndifferent Ministries or Departments\nof the Government of India in\nrespect of measures specified in\nclauses (a), (b) and (c). ”\n</para>\n<para>\n34. The object and purpose of preparing a National\nPlan is to cope up and tackle with all conceivable\ndisasters which the country may face. When the\nmeasures have to be taken for preparedness and\ncapacity building to effectively respond to any\nthreatening disaster situation, the section does not\ncontemplate preparation of Plan after a disaster has\noccurred. \n</para>\n<para>\n35. National Plan and guidelines as contemplated by\nthe statute for Disaster Management is by its very\nnature prior to the occurrence of any disaster and as\n40\na measure of preparedness. It is not conceivable that\na National Plan would be framed after the disaster\nhas occurred. A National Plan encompasses and\ncontemplate all kinds of disasters. \n</para>\n<para>\n36.\nAs noticed above, Biological and Public Health\nEmergencies has already been contemplated in the\nNational Plan, 2019, which as noticed in table 1-1\nunder paragraph 1.13.1 specifically includes\nepidemics: Viral, Bacterial, Parasitic, Fungal and\nprion infections. Novel Coronavirus is an epidemic\nwhich has become a pandemic. Epidemics of different\nnature and extent have taken place in this country as\nwell as other countries of the world. A pandemic is\nan epidemic, i.e., spread over multiple countries/\ncontinents. An epidemic, as a disaster has been known\nand recognized throughout the world with which most\nof the countries are infected time and again. As\nnoticed above, Plan-2019 is complemented by several\nplans, Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), Manuals,\nGuidelines at all levels of the Government. \n41\n</para>\n<para>\n37.\nThe National Disaster Management Authority,\nGovernment of India, had issued National Disaster\nManagement Guidelines in July, 2008 on subject\n“Management of Biological Disasters”. The guideline\nspecifically notices that “Biological Disasters”\nmight be caused by epidemics, the guidelines states:-\n“Biological disasters might be caused by\nepidemics, accidental release of virulent\nmicroorganism(s) or Bioterrorism (BT) with\nthe use of biological agents such as\nanthrax, smallpox, etc. The existence of\ninfectious diseases has been known among\nhuman communities and civilisations since\nthe dawn of the history. The Classical\nliterature of nearly all civilisations\nrecord the ability of major infections to\ndecimate populations, thwart military\ncampaigns and unsettle nations. Social\nupheavals caused by epidemics have\ncontributed in shaping history over the\nages...”\n</para>\n<para>\n38. Thus, the National Disaster Management Authority\nwas well aware of the epidemics and had issued\n42\nguidelines in the year 2008 itself which has been\nfurther detailed in Plan-2019. All aspects of the\nepidemics, all measures to contain an epidemic,\npreparedness, response, mitigation have been\nelaborately dealt in Plan, 2019. Unless the National\nPlan as contemplated under Section 11 contains all\naspects of disaster including the Biological and\nPublic Health Emergencies, it will not be possible\nfor the Governments to immediately respond and\ncontain an epidemic. \n</para>\n<para>\n39. The Disaster Management Act, 2005 contain ample\npowers and measures, which can be taken by the\nNational Disaster Management Authority, National\nExecutive Committee and Central Government to prepare\nfurther plans, guidelines and Standard Operating\nProcedure (SOPs), which in respect to COVID-19 have\nbeen done from time to time. Containment Plan for\nNovel Coronavirus, 2019 has been issued by Ministry\nof Health and Family Welfare, Government of India,\n43\ncopy of which updated up to 16.05.2020 has been\nbrought on record as Annexure-R4. There are no lack\nof guidelines, SOPs and Plan to contain COVID-19, by\nNodal Ministry and Annexure R-6 has been brought on\nrecord issued by Ministry of Health and Family\nWelfare, Government of India, i.e., Updated\nContainment Plan for Large Outbreaks Novel\nCoronavirus Disease, 2019 (COVID-19).\n</para>\n<para>\n40. National Executive Committee as well as Nodal\nMinistry has issued guidelines and orders from time\nto time to regulate all measures to contain COVID-19.\nThe petitioners are not right in their submissions\nthat there is no sufficient plan to deal with COVID-\n19 pandemic. COVID-19 being a Biological and Public\nHealth Emergency, which has been specifically covered\nby National Plan, 2019, which is supplemented by\nvarious plans, guidelines and measures, there is no\nlack or dearth of plans and procedures to deal with\nCOVID-19.\n44\n</para>\n<para>\n41. We may also notice that this Court in Gaurav\nKumar Bansal Vs. Union of India and Others, (2017) 6\nSCC 730, has noticed that National Plan under Section\n11 has already been approved by National Disaster\nManagement Authority. In paragraph 7 of the judgment,\nfollowing was laid down: -\n“7. It was further pointed out that a\nNational plan has been approved and placed\non the website of NDMA in terms of Section\n11 of the Act and the guidelines for\nminimum standards of relief under Section\n12 of the Act have also been placed on the\nwebsite of NDMA.”\n</para>\n<para>\n42. In view of above discussion, we do not find any\nmerit in the claim of the petitioner that Union of\nIndia be directed to prepare a National Plan under\nSection 11 for COVID-19. National Plan, 2019 have\nalready been there in place supplemented by various\norders and measures taken by competent authorities\nunder Disaster Management Act, 2005, there is no\noccasion or need to issue any direction to Union of\n45\nIndia to prepare a fresh National Plan for COVID-19.\nWe, thus, hold that Union of India is not obliged to\nprepare, notify and implement a fresh National\nDisaster Management Plan for COVID-19.\nQUESTION NO.II\nII) Whether the Union of India was obliged to lay\ndown the minimum standards of relief under\nSection 12 of Act, 2005, for COVID-19\nirrespective of earlier guidelines issued under\nSection 12 of the Act laying down the minimum\nstandards of relief?\n</para>\n<para>\n43. Section 12 of the Act, deals with guidelines for\nMinimum Standards of Relief. Section 12 is as\nfollows:-\n“12. Guidelines for minimum standards of\nrelief. —The National Authority shall\nrecommend guidelines for the minimum\nstandards of relief to be provided to\npersons affected by disaster, which shall\ninclude, — \n(i)\nthe minimum requirements to\nbe provided in the relief\ncamps in relation to\nshelter, food, drinking\nwater, medical cover and\nsanitation;\n46\n(ii)\nthe special provisions to\nbe made for widows and\norphans;\n(iii) ex gratia assistance on\naccount of loss of life as\nalso assistance on account\nof damage to houses and for\nrestoration of means of\nlivelihood; \n(iv)\nsuch other relief as may be\nnecessary.”\n</para>\n<para>\n44. The petitioner’s case as noticed above is that\nthe Centre should come up with detailed guidelines\nunder Section 12(ii) and (iii) of Disaster Management\nAct, 2005, recommending special provisions to be made\nfor widows and orphans and ex-gratia assistance to be\nprovided to the kith and kin of those losing life\nbecause of COVID-19 infections but also as a result\nof harsh lockdown restrictions. It is submitted that\nthere are no guidelines providing for minimum\nstandards for COVID-19. The above claim of the\npetitioner is refuted by the respondents. The\nrespondents have brought on record the guidelines of\nminimum standards of relief under Section 12 as\n47\nexisting prior to COVID-19, which has been filed as\nAnnexure-R7 to the counter affidavit. The guidelines\nfiled as Annexure-R7 deals with \n(i) \ndefinition of Relief and Rehabilitation\nCamp, \n(ii) Minimum standards in respect of Shelter in\nrelief camps, \n(iii) Minimum Standards in respect of Food in\nrelief camps,\n(iv) Minimum Standards in respect of Water in\nrelief camps, \n(v)\nMinimum Standards in respect of Sanitation\nin relief camps, \n(vi)\nMinimum Standards in respect of medical\ncover in relief camps and \n(vii) Minimum Standards of Relief for Widows and\nOrphans. \n</para>\n<para>\n45. The guidelines brought on record under Annexure-\nR7, which were in existence since before declaration\n48\nof COVID-19 pandemic, covers all statutory\nrequirement as enumerated in Section 12. Section 12\ncontemplates minimum standards of relief to be\nprovided to persons affected by disaster. The word\n‘disaster’ mentioned in Section 12 encompasses all\nthe disasters including the present disaster. Section\n12 does not contemplate that there shall be different\nguidelines for minimum standards of relief for\ndifferent disasters. \n</para>\n<para>\n46. The uniform guidelines are contemplated so that\npersons affected by disaster are provided with\nminimum requirement in the relief camps in respect of\nshelter, food, drinking water, medical cover and\nsanitation and other reliefs as contemplated in the\nsection. There being already guidelines for minimum\nstandards in place even before COVID-19, the said\nguidelines for minimum standards holds good even for\nthose who are affected by COVID-19. Section 12 does\nnot contemplate that afresh guidelines for the\n49\nminimum standards of relief be issued with regard to\nCOVID-19. The prayer of the petitioner to direct the\nUnion of India to issue fresh guidelines under\nSection 12 to be provided to persons infected with\nCOVID-19 is misconceived. \n</para>\n<para>\n47. The Government of India vide order dated\n14.03.2020 has decided to treat COVID-19, the\npandemic, as a notified disaster for the purpose of\nproviding assistance under State Disaster Response\nFund, norms of assistance for ex-gratia payment to\nfamilies of deceased persons, norms of assistance for\nCOVID-19 positive persons requiring hospitalization\nand some other assistance to be provided from State\nDisaster Response Fund have been notified by the\nGovernment of India. \n</para>\n<para>\n48. In view of the foregoing discussions, we hold\nthat Union of India is not obliged to lay down\nminimum standards of relief under Section 12 of the\n50\nAct, 2005 for COVID-19 and the guidelines issued\nunder Section 12 providing for minimum standards of\nrelief holds good for pandemic COVID-19 also. \nQUESTION NOS. 3, 4 AND 5\nIII) Whether Union of India is obliged to utilise\nNational Disaster Response Fund created under\nSection 46 of the Act for the purpose of\nproviding assistance in the fight of COVID-19?\nIV) \nV) \nWhether all the contributions/grants from\nindividuals and institutions should be\ncredited to the NDRF in terms of Section 46(1)\n(b) of the Act rather than PM CARES Fund?\nWhether all the funds collected in the PM\nCARES Fund till date be directed to be\ntransferred to the NDRF?\n</para>\n<para>\n49. All the three questions being inter-related are\ntaken together. The submissions of the petitioner\ncentre around National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF)\nand PM CARES Fund. We need to notice the nature and\ncharacter of these funds for appreciating the\nsubmissions made by the learned counsel for the\nparties. Chapter IX of the Disaster Management Act,\n2005 deals with Finance, Accounts and Audit. Section\n46 provides for National Disaster Response Fund.\nSection 46 reads:\n51\n“46. National Disaster Response Fund.—(1)\nThe Central Government may, by\nnotification in the Official Gazette,\nconstitute a fund to be called the\nNational Disaster Response Fund for\nmeeting any threatening disaster situation\nor disaster and there shall be credited\nthereto— \n(a) an amount which the Central\nGovernment may, after due\nappropriation\nby\nParliament by law in this\nbehalf provide;\nmade\n \n \n(b) any grants that may be made by\nany person or institution for\nthe purpose of disaster\nmanagement. \n(2) The National Disaster Response\nFund shall be made available to the\nNational Executive Committee to be applied\ntowards meeting the expenses for emergency\nresponse, relief and rehabilitation in\naccordance with the guidelines laid down\nby the Central Government in consultation\nwith the National Authority.”\n</para>\n<para>\n50. The Central Government by notification dated\n27.09.2010 which was published in Gazette\nExtraordinary on 28.09.2010 issued under sub-Section\n(1) of Section 46 of Act, 2005 constituted “National\nDisaster Response Fund”.

Section 46(1) as noted above contemplates\ncrediting of two kind of amounts, i.e., (a) an amount\nwhich the Central Government may, after due\nappropriation made by Parliament by law in this\n53\nbehalf provide; and (b)any grants that may be made by\nany person or institution for the purpose of disaster\nmanagement.\n</para>\n<para>\n52. The guidelines for constitution and\nadministration of NDRF have been brought on record by\nthe petitioner at page 129 of the writ petition. The\nguidelines came into force with effect from financial\nyear 2010-11. Paragraph 3.1 enumerated the calamities\ncovered under NDRF. Paragraph 3.1 is as follows:\n“3.1 Natural calamities of cyclone,\ndrought, earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami,\nhailstorm, landslide, avalanche, cloud\nburst and pest attack considered to be of\nsevere nature by Government of India and\nrequiring expenditure by a State\nGovernment in excess of the balances\navailable in its own State Disaster\nResponse Fund (SDRF), will qualify for\nimmediate relief assistance from NDRF.”\n</para>\n<para>\n53. Paragraph 5 of the guidelines deals with\ncontribution to the NDRF. Paragraphs 5.1 to 5.5 are\nas follows:\n“5.1 The closing balance of the NCCF at\nthe end of financial year 2009-10 shall be\n54\nthe opening balance of the NDRF in the\nyear 2010-11. \n5.2 Funds will be credited into the NDRF\nin accordance with the provisions of the\nDisaster Management Act, 2005. \n5.3 The budget provision for transferring\nfunds to the NDRF as mentioned in para 5.2\nabove shall be made in the Demand for\ngrants no. 35- “Transfers to State and UT\nGovernments” (under non-plan provision).\nReleases to State Governments will be made\nby the Ministry of Finance from this\nprovision. \n5.4 During the years 2010-15 transfers to\nthe NDRF established in the Public Account\nof India will be made by operating the\nfollowing heads of account: Major Head\n“2245-Relief on account of Natural\nCalamities – 80- General-797-Transfers to\nReserve Funds and Deposit Account’-\nTransfer to National Disaster Response\nFund. \n5.5 Contributions made by any person or\ninstitution for the purpose of disaster\nmanagement will also be credited to the\nNDRF.\nsuch\ncontributions will be prescribed in due\ncourse.”\nModalities\n \n \ncovering\n \n</para>\n<para>\n54. Paragraph 7.1 of the guidelines deals with\nassessment of relief assistance from the NDRF.\nParagraph 7.1 is as follows:\n55\n“7.1 Upon a request made by a State not\nhaving adequate balance in its State\nDisaster Response Fund (SDRF), Ministry of\nHome Affairs or the Ministry of\nAgriculture, as the case may be, will\nassess whether a case for additional\nassistance from NDRF is made out under\nthese guidelines and the approved items\nand norms of assistance under NDRF/SDRF.\nThe following procedure will be adopted\nfor making such assessment:\n(i)\n(ii)\nThe memorandum of the State\nGovernment will be examined to\nassess the likely requirement\nof funds as per items and\nnorms of expenditure under\nSDRF/NDRF.

The guidelines for administration of the NDRF\nhave been revised with effect from financial year\n2015-16 which have been brought on record at page 154\nof the writ petition. Paragraph 3.1 of the guidelines\nis same as under guidelines for the financial year\n2010-11. Paragraph 4.1 provides:\n“4.1 The NDRF will be operated by the\nGovernment of India for the purpose of\nproviding immediate relief to people\naffected by the above mentioned calamities\nwhich are assessed as being of ‘severe\nnature’, following the procedure described\nin para 7 of these guidelines.

Paragraph 5 deals with contribution to the NDRF\nand there are some changes in the guidelines in\nparagraph 5. Paragraphs 5.1 to 5.4 of the new\nguidelines are as follows:\n“5.1 The closing balance of the NDRF at\nthe end of financial year 2014-15\nshall be the opening balance of the\nNDRF in the year 2015-16. \n5.2 Funds will be credited into the NDRF\nin accordance with the provisions of\nthe section 46 (a) & (b) of Disaster\nManagement Act, 2005. \n5.3 The budget provision for transferring\nfunds to the NDRF as mentioned in para\n5.2 above shall be made in the Demand\nfor grants no. 35- “Transfers to State\nand UT Governments” (under non-plan\nprovision).

As per paragraph 10 of\nthe new guidelines, expenditure from NDRF is meant to\nassist a State to provide immediate relief in those\ncases of severe calamity, where the expenditure\nrequired is in excess of the balance in the State’s\nSDRF. The NDRF is a statutory fund required to be\naudited by the Comptroller & Auditor General of\nIndia, which was constituted under Act, 2005 and is\nstill in existence for the purposes as enumerated in\nthe statute as well as in the guidelines issued under\nAct, 2005. \n</para>\n<para>\n58. We may now notice the PM CARES Fund. Petitioner\nhas brought on record certain details of PM CARES\nFund as Annexure-P13. The details about the PM CARES\nFund as brought on record as Annexure-P13 of the writ\npetition are as follows:\n59\n“Keeping in mind the need for having a\ndedicated national fund with the primary\nobjective of dealing with any kind of\nemergency or distress situation, like\nposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, and to\nprovide relief to the affected, a public\ncharitable trust under the name of ‘Prime\nMinister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief\nin Emergency Situations Fund’ (PM CARES\nFund)’ has been set up. \nClick here to Donate Online.\nObjectives :\n• To undertake and support relief or\nassistance of any kind relating to a\npublic health emergency or any other kind\nof emergency, calamity or distress, either\nman-made or natural, including the\ncreation or upgradation of healthcare or\npharmaceutical facilities, other necessary\ninfrastructure, funding relevant research\nor any other type of support.\n• To render financial assistance, provide\ngrants of payments of money or take such\nother steps as may be deemed necessary by\nthe Board of Trustees to the affected\npopulation.\n• To undertake any other activity, which\nis not inconsistent with the above\nObjects.\n60\nConstitution of the Trust :\n• Prime Minister is the ex-officio\nChairman of the PM CARES Fund and Minister\nof Defence, Minister of Home Affairs and\nMinister of Finance, Government of India\nare ex-officio Trustees of the Fund.\n• The Chairperson of the Board of Trustees\n(Prime Minister) shall have the power to\nnominate three trustees to the Board of\nTrustees who shall be eminent persons in\nthe field of research, health, science,\nsocial work, law, public administration\nand philanthropy.\n• Any person appointed a Trustee shall act\nin a pro bono capacity.\nOther details :\n \n \nfrom\n• The fund consists entirely of voluntary\ncontributions\nindividuals/\norganizations and does not get any\nbudgetary support. The fund will be\nutilised in meeting the objectives as\nstated above.\n• Donations to PM CARES Fund would qualify\nfor 80G benefits for 100% exemption under\nthe Income Tax Act, 1961. Donations to PM\nCARES Fund will also qualify to be counted\nas Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)\nexpenditure under the Companies Act, 2013\n• PM CARES Fund has also got exemption\nunder the FCRA and a separate account for\nreceiving foreign donations has been\nopened. This enables PM CARES Fund to\n61\naccept donations and contributions from\nindividuals and organizations based in\nforeign countries. This is consistent with\nrespect to Prime Minister’s National\nRelief Fund (PMNRF). PMNRF has also\nreceived foreign contributions as a public\ntrust since 2011.\nCLICK HERE TO DONATE ONLINE”\n</para>\n<para>\n59. From the above details, it is clear that PM CARES\nFund has been constituted as a public charitable\ntrust. After outbreak of pandemic COVID-19, need of\nhaving a dedicated national fund with objective of\ndealing with any kind of emergency or distress\nsituation, like posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, and\nto provide relief to the affected, a fund was created\nby constituting a trust with Prime Minister as an ex-\nofficio Chairman of PM CARES Fund, with other ex-\nofficio and nominated Trustees of the Fund. The PM\nCARES Fund consists entirely of voluntary\ncontributions from individuals/organisations and does\nnot get any Budgetary support. No Government money is\ncredited in the PM CARES Fund. \n62\n</para>\n<para>\n60. After noticing constitution of NDRF as well as PM\nCARES Fund now we may notice the contentions raised\nby Shri Dave. The submission of Shri Dave is that the\nearlier guidelines for administration of NDRF which\ncame into force with effect from financial year 2010-\n11 have been modified by new guidelines with effect\nfrom financial year 2015-16, and now it is not\npossible for any person or institution to make\ncontribution to the NDRF. Shri Dave submits that\nparagraph 5.5 of earlier guidelines has been deleted\nto benefit the PM CARES Fund so that all\ncontributions by any person or institution should go\nin the PM CARES Fund. Shri Dave submits that deletion\nof paragraph 5.5 of earlier guidelines (at page 130)\nin the new guidelines (at page 154-155) makes it\nclear that now it is not possible for any person or\ninstitution to make any contribution to NDRF. \n61.\nThere are two reasons for not accepting the above\nsubmission. Firstly, paragraph 5.5 of earlier\nguidelines which contemplated contributions by any\n63\nperson or institution for the purpose of disaster\nmanagement to the NDRF are very much still there in\nthe new guidelines, which have come into force with\neffect from financial year 2015-16. New guidelines\ncontain the same heading, i.e., “Contribution to the\nNDRF” and guideline 5.2 provides “Funds will be\ncredited into the NDRF in accordance with the\nprovisions of the Section 46(1)(a) & (b) of the\nDisaster Management Act, 2005.” The above guideline\n5.2 specifically referred to Section 46(1)(a) & (b)\nand Section 46(1)(b) expressly provides that any\ngrants that may be made by any person or institution\nfor the purpose of disaster management shall be\ncredited into the NDRF. The submission that after the\nnew guidelines, it is not possible for any person or\ninstitution to make any contribution to the NDRF is,\nthus, misconceived and incorrect. According to the\nstatutory provisions of Section 46 as well as new\nguidelines enforced with effect from financial year\n64\n2015-16 any person or institution can still make\ncontribution to the NDRF.\n \n</para>\n<para>\n62.\nSecondly, the PM CARES Fund has been constituted\nin the year 2020 after outbreak of pandemic COVID-19\nwhereas the new guidelines came into force with\neffect from 2015-16, on which date the PM CARES Fund\nwas not in existence, hence, the submission that new\nguidelines were amended to benefit the PM CARES Fund\nis wholly misconceived.\n</para>\n<para>\n63. Another limb of submission of Shri Dave is that\nalthough the Government of India vide its letter\ndated 14.03.2020 has decided to treat COVID-19 as a\nnotified disaster for the purpose of providing\nassistance under SDRF but no similar notification has\nbeen issued for the purpose of providing assistance\nfor COVID-19 under NDRF. The notification dated\n14.03.2020 has been brought on record as Annexure-P10\nof the writ petition which reads as follows:\n65\n “No.33-4/2020-NDM-I\nGovernment of India\nMinistry of Home Affairs\n(Disaster Management Division)\nC-Wing, 3rd Floor, NDCC-II\nJai Singh Road, New Delhi -110001\nDated 14.03.2020\nTo\nThe Chief Secretaries\n (All States)\nSubject: Items and Norms of assistance\nfrom the State Disaster Response\nFund (SDRF) in wake of COVID-19\nVirus Outbreak\nSir/Madam\nI am directed to refer this Ministry’s\nletter No.32-7/2014 dated 8th April, 2015\non the above mentioned subject.\n2.\nThe Central Government, keeping in\nview the spread of COVID-19 virus in India\nand the declaration of COVID-19 as\npandemic by the World Health Organisation\n(WHO), by way of a special one time\ndispensation, has decided to treat it as a\nnotified disaster for the purpose of\nproviding assistance under SDRF. A list\nof items and norms of assistance for\ncontainment of COVID-19 Virus in India\neligible from SDRF is annexed. \nYours faithfully,\n66\n(Sanjeev Kumar Jindal)\nJoint Secretary to Government of India\nTel: 23438096\nCopy to AS(UT), MHA for making similar\nprovisions for utilization of UT Disaster\nResponse Funds by the Union Territories. \nCC for information: PS to HM/MOS(N)/HS”\n</para>\n<para>\n64. After issuance of the above notification, the\nGovernment of India, Ministry of Home Affairs\n(Disaster Management Division) issued order of\n03.04.2020 on the subject: “Advance release of\nCentral share from State Disaster Risk Management\nFund (SDRMF) for the year 2020-21”. By the said order\nthe Central Government has released first instalment\nof Rs. 11,092/- crores out of Rs.22,184/- crores\nwhich was the Central Share of SDRMF. All States\nhave been allocated different amounts for the purpose\nof providing assistance under SDRMF. Annexure to the\nsaid notification is at page 161, which indicates\nthat maximum grant allocated was to the State of\nMaharashtra as Rs.1,611/- crores as first instalment\n67\nand minimum amount to State of Goa, i.e., Rs.6/-\ncrores by the Centre. The notification dated\n14.03.2020 clearly permits providing the assistance\nunder SDRMF for COVID-19. In event, any State\nexpenditure is in excess of the balance in the\nState’s SDRMF, the State is entitled for the release\nof fund from NDRF as it is clear from new guidelines\nfiled at pages 154 to 158 of the writ petition. The\nsubmission of the petitioner that NDRF cannot be used\nfor any assistance for COVID-19, thus, cannot be\naccepted. \n</para>\n<para>\n65. There is one more aspect of the matter which\nneeds to be noted. When the Centre is providing\nfinancial assistance to the State to take measures to\ncontain COVID-19, as we have noticed above that by\norder dated 03.04.2020 first instalment of Rs.\n11,092/- crores which is the Central Share to the\nSDRMF has been given and there is nothing on record\nthat any State has exceeded the expenditure in excess\n68\nof the balance in the State’s SDRMF, there is no\noccasion of asking more fund by the State from NDRF.\nWhen the Central Government is providing financial\nassistance to the States to contain COVID-19 it is\nnot for any PIL petitioner to say that Centre should\ngive amount from this fund or that fund. The\nfinancial planning is in the domain of the Central\nGovernment, which financial planning is made after\ndue deliberation and consideration. We, thus, do not\nfind any substance in the submission of the\npetitioner that there is any statutory\nrestriction/prohibition in utilization of NDRF for\nCOVID-19. More so when sub-section (2) of Section 46\nspecifically provides that NDRF shall be made\navailable to the National Executive Committee to be\napplied towards meeting the expenses for emergency\nresponse, relief and rehabilitation in accordance\nwith the guidelines laid down by the Central\nGovernment, the NDRF can be used for containment of\nCOVID-19. \n69\n</para>\n<para>\n66. Further as observed above, it is for the Central\nGovernment to take the decision as from which fund\nwhat financial measures are to be taken and it is\nneither for PIL petitioner to claim that any\nfinancial assistance be made from particular fund nor\nthis Court to sit in judgment over the financial\ndecisions of the Central Government.\n</para>\n<para>\n67.\nThe PM CARES Fund is a public charitable trust\nand is not a Government fund. The charitable trusts\nare public trusts. Black’s Law Dictionary, Tenth\nEdition defines charitable trust in following words:\n“charitable trust. A trust created to\nbenefit a specific charity, specific\ncharities, or the general public rather\nthan a private individual or entity.\nCharitable trusts are often eligible for\nfavorable tax treatment.”\n</para>\n<para>\n68. The mere fact that administration of the Trust is\nvested in trustees, i.e., a group of people, will not\n70\nitself take away the public character of the Trust as\nhas been laid down in Mulla Gulam Ali & Safiabai D.\nTrust Vs. Deelip Kumar & Co., (2003) 11 SCC 772. In\nparagraph 4, this Court laid down:\n“4. The mere fact that the control in\nrespect of the administration of the Trust\nvested in a group of people will not\nitself take away the public character of\nthe Trust……………………………..”\n \n</para>\n<para>\n69. The contributions made by individuals and\ninstitutions in the PM CARES Fund are to be released\nfor public purpose to fulfill the objective of the\ntrust. The PM CARES Fund is a charitable trust\nregistered under the Registration Act, 1908 at New\nDelhi on 27.03.2020. The trust does not receive any\nBudgetary support or any Government money. It is not\nopen for the petitioner to question the wisdom of\ntrustees to create PM CARES fund which was\nconstituted with an objective to extend assistance in\nthe wake of public health emergency that is pandemic\nCOVID-19. \n71\n</para>\n<para>\n70.\nShri Dave during submissions has fairly submitted\nthat he is not questioning the bona fide of\nconstitution of PM CARES Fund. His submission is\nthat NDRF is audited by CAG but PM CARES Fund is not\naudited by CAG rather by a private Chartered\nAccountant. The nature of NDRF and PM CARES Fund are\nentirely different. The guidelines issued under Act,\n2005 with regard to NDRF specifically provides for\naudit of the NDRF by the Comptroller & Auditor\nGeneral of India whereas for public charitable trust\nthere is no occasion for audit by the Comptroller &\nAuditor General of India. \n</para>\n<para>\n71.\nWe may notice one more aspect with regard to\nCOVID-19. We have noticed above that guidelines which\nwere issued for constitution and administration of\nNDRF and State’s SDRMF, the guidelines provided\nutilization of fund for limited calamities, which did\nnot include any biological and public health\nemergency. We have already noticed Clause 3.1 of\n72\nguidelines for administration of NDRF, which did not\nprovide for the calamities which cover the biological\nand public health emergency. Thus, under the\nguidelines which were in existence with effect from\nfinancial year 2015-16 neither NDRF nor SDRF covered\nthe biological and public health emergencies. It was\nonly by notification dated 14.03.2020 that COVID-19\nwas treated as notified disaster for the purpose of\nproviding assistance under SDRF. Obviously prior to\nthis notification dated 14.03.2020 no contribution by\nany person or institution in the NDRF could have been\nmade with respect to specified disaster, namely,\nbiological and public health emergency like COVID-19,\nOutbreak of COVID-19 in India as well as other\ncountries of the World required immediate enhancement\nin the infrastructure of medical health and creation\nof fund to contain COVID-19. At this need of the hour\nno exception can be taken to the constitution of a\npublic charitable trust, namely, PM CARES Fund to\nhave necessary financial resources to meet the\n73\nemergent situation.\n \n</para>\n<para>\n72.\nThe NDRF and PM CARES Fund are two entirely\ndifferent funds with different object and purpose. In\nview of the foregoing discussions, we answer question\nNos.3, 4 and 5 in following manner:\nAnswer 3.\nThe Union of India can very well\nutilize the NDRF for providing assistance in the\nfight of COVID-19 pandemic by way of releasing\nfund on the request of the States as per new\nguidelines. \nAnswer 4. Any contribution, grant of any\nindividual or institution is not prohibited to be\ncredited into the NDRF and it is still open for\nany person or institution to make contribution to\nthe NDRF in terms of Section 46(1)(b) of the Act,\n2005. The contribution by any person or by any\n74\ninstitution in PM CARES Fund is voluntary and it\nis open for any person or institution to make\ncontribution to the PM CARES Fund.\nAnswer 5.\nThe funds collected in the PM CARES\nFund are entirely different funds which are funds\nof a public charitable trust and there is no\noccasion for issuing any direction to transfer\nthe said funds to the NDRF. \n</para>\n<para>\n73.\nIn view of the foregoing discussions, the prayer\n‘a’ and ‘b’ made in the writ petition are refused.\nWith respect to prayer ‘c’, we make it clear (i) that\nthere is no statutory prohibition for the Union of\nIndia utilizing the NDRF for providing assistance in\nthe fight of COVID-19 in accordance with the\nguidelines issued for administration of NDRF; (ii)\nthere is no statutory prohibition in making any\ncontribution by any person or institution in the NDRF\nas per Section 46(1)(b)of the Act, 2005. \n75\n</para>\n<para>\n74.\nThe prayer of the petitioner to direct all the\nfunds collected in the PM CARES Fund till date to be\ntransferred to the NDRF is refused. \n75. Subject to clarification of law as made above,\nthe writ petition is dismissed. \n</para>\n\n ( ASHOK BHUSHAN )\n......................J.\n ( R. SUBHASH REDDY )\n......................J.\n ( M.R. SHAH )\nNew Delhi,\nAugust 18, 2020.\n......................J.\n.\n    here's the document you need to chunk.\n    Test: 1\nREPORTABLE\nIN THE \nCIVIL ORIGINAL JURISDICTION\nWRIT PETITION (CIVIL) NO. 787 OF 2017\nVarunarjun Trust and Anr.\n….Petitioners \nUnion of India and Ors.\n....Respondents\nVersus \nA.M. KHANWILKAR, J.\n\nJ U D G M E N T\n1. The petitioners made an application for establishment of a\nnew medical college at Banthra, Shahjahanpur, U.P., in the\nname and style of Varunarjun Medical College from\nacademic session 2016-17 onwards, to the Ministry of\nHealth and Family Welfare, Government of India. The\nMinistry forwarded that application to the Medical Council\nof India (for short “MCI”) for evaluation and making\nrecommendations under Section 10A of the Indian Medical\nCouncil Act, 1956 (for short “the 1956 Act”). The MCI\nconducted an assessment of the petitioner college on 12th\n2\nand 13th January, 2016. On the basis of the assessment\nreport, the Executive Committee of MCI, in its meeting held\non 30th January, 2016, decided to make negative\nrecommendations, in view of a large number of deficiencies\nnoticed in the assessment report. A formal communication\nin that behalf was sent to the Central Government by MCI\nvide letter dated 31st January, 2016. The Ministry then\nafforded an opportunity of hearing to the college before a\nHearing Committee on 25th February, 2016. The Hearing\nCommittee concurred with the recommendation of MCI and\nsubmitted its observations to the Ministry to disapprove the\nproposal. Later on, compliance verification assessment was\ndone by MCI on 30th March, 2016, which report was duly\nconsidered by the Executive Committee of MCI in its\nmeeting held on 13th May, 2016. Once again, MCI in its\nmeeting held on 13th May, 2016 decided to give negative\nrecommendations in view of the deficiencies noticed in the\ncompliance verification assessment. That opinion was\nformally communicated by the MCI to the Ministry vide\nletter dated 14th May, 2016. The Ministry accepted the\nrecommendation of MCI and disapproved the application for\n3\nestablishment of a new medical college for academic session\n \n2016-17 vide letter dated 8th June, 2016.\n2. The Oversight Committee (for short “OC”) constituted by\nthis Court, however, issued a directive to the Ministry to\nobtain fresh compliance from the college and forward it to\nMCI. Pursuant to the said directive, MCI submitted its\ncompliance to the Ministry citing various reasons. However,\nthe OC approved the scheme of establishment of a new\nmedical college with annual intake of 150 students for the\nacademic year 2016-17, on certain conditions. The Central\nGovernment, therefore, issued a formal approval-cum-Letter\nof Permission (for short “LOP”) on 12th September, 2016\nincorporating the conditions imposed by the OC. \n3. As per the conditions noted in the said LOP, an assessment\nwith regard to verification compliance submitted by the\ncollege was conducted by the MCI on 18th & 19th November,\n2016. During the said verification, certain deficiencies were\nnoticed which were mentioned in the assessment report.\nThe assessment report was duly considered by the\nExecutive Committee of MCI in its meeting held on 22nd\nDecember, 2016. In view of the deficiencies, MCI decided to\nsend a negative recommendation to the Ministry. The\ndeficiencies noticed were as follows:\n4\n“i. Deficiency of faculty is 16.79% as detailed in the report. \nii. Shortage of Residents was 21.73% as detailed in the\nreport. \niii. There was only 1 Minor Operation on day of assessment. \niv. There was 1 normal Delivery & NIL Caesarean Section on\nday of assessment. \nv. ICUs: There was only 1 patient each in MICU & SICU and\n2 patients each in ICCU & PICU/NICU on day of\nassessment. \nvi. Details of Paramedical & Non-teaching staff available in\nthe Institute are not provided. \nvii. MRD: ICD X classification of diseases is not followed for\nindexing. \nviii. Central Library: It is not air-conditioned.” \n4. The decision of the MCI was formally communicated to the\nMinistry vide letter dated 26th December, 2016. After receipt\nof the recommendation from the MCI, the Ministry decided\nto afford a personal hearing to the college on 17th January,\n2017 before the Director General of Health Services (DGHS).\nThe Hearing Committee considered the oral and written\nsubmissions of the college, but was not satisfied with the\nexplanation given by the petitioners for want of proper\nevidence. The Hearing Committee submitted its report to\n5\nthe Ministry, which in turn forwarded the same to the OC\nfor guidance. The OC vide letter dated 14th May, 2017\nconveyed its views to the Ministry as follows: \n \n(i)\n(ii)\nFaculty: In the Standard Assessment Forms (SAF),\nPrincipal has mentioned that 4 faculty members had gone\nfor exchange/withdrawal of money from the bank with\npermission of the Principal and 3 were on sanctioned\nleave. Considering this explanation, the deficiency would\nbe 6.15%, which is within the acceptable limits. \nResidents:- In the SAF, Principal has mentioned that 5\nResidents had gone for exchange/withdrawal of money\nfrom the bank with permission of the Principal and 3 were\non sanctioned leave. Considering these residents, the\ndeficiency would be 4.34%, which is within the\nacceptable limits. \n(iii) Minor operation:- This deficiency is subjective. No MSR. \n(iv) Deliveries:- This deficiency is subjective. No MSR. \n(v)\nICCU & PICU/NICU:- This deficiency is subjective. No\nMSR. \n(vi) Non-teaching staff:- There is no such mention in SAF\n2.24. \n(vii) Central Library:- There is no such mention in the previous\nassessment report. However, the explanation of the\nCollege is acceptable. \nLOP Confirmed.”\n5. The Ministry after considering the recommendation of the\nMCI, the report of the DGHS and the views received from\nthe OC, finally chose to accept the recommendation of the\nMCI. The decision of the Ministry was communicated to the\npetitioner college vide letter dated 31st May, 2017, debarring\nthe college from admitting students for two years i.e.\n6\n2017-18 & 2018-19, and also authorising the MCI to\nencash the bank guarantee.\n6. Feeling aggrieved by the said decision, the petitioners filed a\nwrit petition before the Allahabad High Court, being WP (C)\nNo.15302 of 2017 which was disposed of on 8th August,\n2017 following the decision of this Court in the case of\nGlocal Medical College & Super Speciality Hospital\nand Research Centre Vs. Union of India and Anr.1,\ndecided on 1st August, 2017.\n7. Pursuant to the aforementioned decision of the High Court,\nthe Ministry granted a hearing to the petitioner college on\n16th August, 2017. It appears that the Hearing Committee\nconsidered the record, oral and written submissions of the\ncollege also the fresh representation given by the college.\nThe Hearing Committee then submitted its report to the\nMinistry. Relying on the said recommendation of the\nHearing Committee, the Ministry vide order dated 19th\nAugust, 2017 reiterated its earlier decision dated 31st May,\n2017, debarring the college from admitting students for a\nperiod of two years i.e. 2017-18 & 2018-19 and also,\nauthorising MCI to encash the bank guarantee of Rs.2\n1\n 2017 (8) SCALE 356\n7\nCrore. This decision of the Ministry was communicated to\nthe petitioners. The crucial part of this decision is in\nparagraphs 17 and 18 which read as follows: \n“17. Now, therefore, in compliance with the above direction\nof Court, the Ministry granted hearing to the college on\n16.8.2017. The Hearing Committee after considering the\nrecords and oral & written submission of the college\nsubmitted its report to the Ministry. The findings of the\nHearing Committee are as under:\nThe college has tried to explain deficiency of 4\nfaculty and 5 residents in terms of visit to bank for\ncurrency exchange in the wake of demonetization.\nThis could be a plausible explanation but the\nCommittee is not inclined to accept it as it cannot be\nproved. Further, such absence during duty hours\ncannot be overlooked. The Committee inquired from\nthe college why the 5 residents on night off could not\ncome, even late, for the head count. They would have\nbeen accordingly reflected as such in the SAF. \nThe college claimed 6 minor operations on the\nday of assessment but could not produce supportive\ndocument or evidence, which they claimed to have\nsubmitted in the earlier hearing. \nThe contention of college on MRD and library is\naccepted and the deficiency may not exist. The\ncollege should be having paramedical non teaching\nstaff but they did not produce the list/documents\nbefore the Hearing Committee. \nIn view of the above the Committee agrees with\nthe decision of the Ministry vide letter dated\n31.05.2017 to debar the college for two years and\nalso permit MCI to encash bank guarantee. \n18. Accepting the recommendations of the Hearing\nCommittee, the Ministry reiterates its earlier decision dated\n31.05.2017 to debar the college from admitting students for\na period of two years i.e. 2017-18 and 2018-19 and also to\nauthorize MCI to encash the Bank Guarantee of Rs.2 Crore.”\n8\n8. Aggrieved, the petitioners have prayed for quashing of the\nsaid order and further, directing respondent No.1 (Union of\nIndia through Secretary, Ministry of Health and Family\nWelfare) to issue first renewal of Letter of Permission for\nadmission of the 2nd batch of 150 MBBS students in the\npetitioner college for the academic session 2017-18 and also\nrefrain from encashing the bank guarantee dated 15th\nSeptember, 2017 offered by the petitioners in favour of MCI\n \nin the sum of Rs.2 Crore.\n9. According to the petitioners, they had placed all the relevant\nmaterial before the Competent Authority of the Central\nGovernment, clearly indicating that the deficiencies noticed\nin the concerned assessment report were insignificant and\nwithin permissible limit. Our attention was invited to the\ncommunication sent by the MCI dated 26th December, 2016,\nhighlighting the deficiencies noticed by the Council\nAssessors on 18th & 19th November, 2016. The petitioners\nhave also relied on the explanation offered by the petitioners\nbefore the Hearing Committee as well as OC. It is\ncontended that the explanation found favour with the OC.\nThe Competent Authority of the Central Government has,\n9\nhowever, completely disregarded the opinion of the OC. It\nwas then contended that the recent report of the Hearing\nCommittee does not take the matter any further. The\nrelevant portion of the said report has been extracted in\nparagraph 17 of the impugned decision of the Ministry. On\nthe one hand, the Hearing Committee observed that the\nexplanation offered by the petitioner college regarding\nabsence of faculty and residents was plausible, but it still\nchose to disregard that explanation on the specious ground\nthat it was not proved. Further, no analysis as to why the\nopinion of the OC should be deviated is found in the\nobservations of the Hearing Committee. It is contended\nthat the absence of faculty and residents on the day of\ninspection ought to be excluded, in which case the\ndeficiency of faculty would stand reduced to only 6.15% and\nof residents to only 4.34%. Further, the adverse\nobservations noted by the Hearing Committee with regard to\nminor operations and paramedical non-teaching staff is not\nconsistent with the record produced by the petitioner\ncollege during the hearing. It is submitted that in view of\nthe recent pronouncements of this Court in respect of other\n10\ninstitutions, similar relief be given to the petitioner\ninstitution. A comparative chart of the deficiencies in\nrespect of the said institutions was produced before us to\ncontend that in so far as the petitioner college is concerned,\nthe deficiencies were marginal and relatively less. The main\ngrievance of the petitioners is that despite clear directions\ngiven by the Court to consider the proposal of the petitioner\ncollege after taking into account the material produced and\nexplanation offered by the petitioners, including the fresh\nrepresentation, neither the Hearing Committee nor the\nCompetent Authority of the Central Government has\nadverted to the explanation and material relied upon by the\npetitioners. Moreso, neither the Hearing Committee nor the\nCompetent Authority of the Central Government has\nanalysed the opinion of the OC which had accepted the\nexplanation or recorded any reason to deviate from the\nsame. The fresh decision of the Competent Authority of the\nCentral Government is, again, a mechanical order, if not\nperverse. It is against the spirit of the directions issued by\nthe Court to reconsider the proposal afresh and record\nreasons. It is, therefore, submitted that the impugned\n11\ndecision deserves to be quashed and set aside and further\ndirections should be issued to the respondents to issue\nconfirmation of Letter of Permission in favour of the\npetitioner college for the academic session 2016-17 and also\nallow the petitioner college to admit 150 students in the\nsecond batch of the MBBS course for the academic session\n2017-18.\n10.\nPer contra, the respondents submit that the final\ndecision of the Competent Authority of the Central\nGovernment is just and proper, in the fact situation of the\npresent case. Inasmuch as the Hearing Committee did not\naccept the explanation offered by the petitioner regarding\nthe deficiencies relating to faculty members and residents.\nThe Hearing Committee was also not convinced with the\nexplanation given by the petitioners about their claim of 6\n(six) minor operations as the college had failed to produce\nsupporting documents and evidence in that regard.\nSimilarly, the college failed to produce material to\nsubstantiate that the college had paramedical non-teaching\nstaff which was one of the essential requirements. Learned\ncounsel for the respondents submitted that the recent\n12\ndecisions rendered by this Court on which reliance has\nbeen placed, were on the facts of the concerned case. Our\nattention was also invited to the relevant provisions of the\nAct, Regulations and Statutory Scheme formulated for\nconsideration of application for permission to establish a\nmedical college. It is submitted that the assessment done by\nthe MCI in the present case was with regard to the\nverification of the compliance submitted by the college for\nconsidering the proposal for confirmation of conditional LOP\ngranted to the petitioner college for the academic session\n2016-2017. For that reason, the minimum standards\nregarding infrastructure and academic requirements as\npostulated in the Statutory Scheme must govern the\nconsideration of the proposal. The benchmark regarding\ninfrastructure and academics to be fulfilled by the applicant\ncollege for permission to establish medical college are\npre-conditions. However, without fulfilment of those\nconditions, conditional LOP was granted to the petitioner\ncollege on the basis of direction issued by the OC, which\nwas then acted upon by the Central Government by issuing\na formal LOP for the academic session 2016-2017 on\n13\nconditions specified by the OC. The college has failed to\nfulfil those conditions as was noticed during the verification\nof compliance. It is submitted that no indulgence be shown\nto the petitioner college, much less, grant further relief\nclaimed to allow the petitioner college to admit students in\nthe second batch of the MBBS course for the academic\nsession 2017-18.\n11.\nHeard Mr. Rajiv Dhavan, learned senior counsel along\nwith Mr. Abdhesh Chaudhary, learned counsel for the\npetitioner, Mr. Maninder Singh, learned Additional Solicitor\nGeneral for Union of India and Mr. Vikas Singh, learned\nsenior counsel along with Mr. Gaurav Sharma, learned\ncounsel for the Medical Council of India. \n12.\nWe must first answer the submission of the petitioners\nthat the satisfaction recorded by the OC whilst accepting\nthe explanation offered by the petitioners was binding on\nthe Central Government. We do not agree with this\nsubmission. It is one thing to say that the\nsatisfaction/opinion recorded by the OC constituted by this\nCourt is a relevant matter and which must receive due\nattention of the Hearing Committee as well as the Central\n14\nGovernment. But it is not possible to accept the contention\nthat the opinion of OC must bind the Hearing Committee\nand the Central Government whilst discharging their\nstatutory duties, moreso, when the legislative scheme of the\nAct has bestowed the final authority upon the Central\nGovernment to grant or refuse to grant permission in terms\nof Section 10-A of the Act. \n13.\nHaving said this, we may now advert to the\ndeficiencies noticed in the assessment report regarding\nverification of compliance submitted by the college. The\ndeficiencies noticed in the said report in respect of faculty\nmembers and residents were sought to be explained by the\ncollege - that 4 (four) faculty members and 5 (five) residents\nhad gone for exchange/withdrawal of money from the bank\nwith permission of the Principal and 3 (three) were on\nsanctioned leave. This explanation commended to the OC as\nplausible and on that basis, the OC was of the view that\ndeficiency in respect of faculty members would stand\nreduced to the permissible limit. \n Hence, the OC\nrecommended confirmation of LOP. The Hearing Committee,\nhowever, observed that the petitioner college did not\n15\nsubstantiate the stand so taken. Further, absence of such\nlarge number of faculties and residents during\nworking-duty hours could not be countenanced.\nAdditionally, the Hearing Committee was of the view that\nthe college was not able to explain the absence of 5 (five)\nresidents who were on night off and yet could not come,\neven late, for the head count. Besides, no entry to that effect\nwas recorded in the Standard Assessment Forms (for short,\n“SAF”). The OC, however, has not commented on this aspect\nof the matter at all. In our opinion, the view taken by the\nCompetent Authority of the Central Government is a\npossible view. \n The pre-conditions to maintain high\nacademic standards for imparting MBBS course cannot be\nundermined. In this case, the deficiency of faculty and\nresidents was significant, besides the other two deficiencies\ntaken note of by the Hearing Committee and the Central\nGovernment in the impugned decision. For that, the college\ndid not produce supportive documents or evidence in\nrespect of its claim of 6 (six) minor operations and list of\nparamedical non-teaching staff. These deficiencies cannot\n16\nbe treated as trivial or unrelated to maintenance of high\nstandards of imparting medical education.\n14.\nWe are conscious of the fact that the proposal under\nconsideration was for establishment of a new medical\ncollege from academic session 2016-17 and that has to be\nexamined keeping in mind the norms specified in the\nstatutory scheme formulated regarding permission to\nestablish a new medical college. That scheme postulates the\nminimum standard of education, which has been\nformulated by the MCI in terms of Section 19-A of the Act.\nThe scheme provides for minimum infrastructure facilities\nand staff requirements for 100 admissions. It also provides\nguidance as to how deficiency in respect of those matters\nshould be calculated. The Medical Council of India has\npublished those norms and the schemes for requirements to\nbe fulfilled by the applicant College(s) for obtaining Letter of\nIntent and Letter of Permission for establishment of a new\nmedical college and for yearly renewal under Section 10-A of\nthe Act. Inter alia, it provides as follows:-\n“Notes:\nFor purpose of working out the deficiency:\n(1) The deficiency of teaching faculty and Resident Doctors shall be\n17\ncounted separately.\n(A) For Teaching Faculty:\n(a) For calculating the deficiency of faculty, Prof. Assoc Prof., Asst. Prof & Tutor\nin respective departments shall be counted together.\n(b) Any excess teaching faculty in higher cadre can compensate the deficiency of\nlower cadre of the same department only.\n(c) Any excess teaching faculty of lower cadre/category in any department\ncannot compensate the deficiency of any teaching faculty in the higher\ncadre/category of the same department or any other department. e.g. excess of\nAssistant Professor cannot compensate the deficiency of Associate Professor or\nProfessor.\n(d) Excess/Extra teaching faculty of any department cannot compensate the\ndeficiency of any teaching faculty in any other department. \n(B) For Resident Doctors:\n(a) Excess of SR can be compensated to the deficiency of JR of the same\ndepartment only. \n(b) Excess SR/JR of any department cannot compensate the deficiency of SR/JR\nin any other department.\n(c)Any excess of JR cannot compensate the deficiency of SR in same or any other\ndepartment.\n(d) Any excess/extra teaching faculty of same or any other department cannot\ncompensate the deficiency of SR/JR.\ne.g. excess of Assistant Professor cannot compensate the deficiency of SR or JR.\n(2) A separate department of Dentistry/Dental faculty is not required where a\ndental college is available in same campus/city and run by the same\nmanagement.\n(3) College running PG programme require additional staff, beds & other\nrequirements as per the PG Regulations – 2000.\nDesignat\nion\nLOP\n(1st Batch)\nIst Renewal \n(2nd Batch)\nFaculty\ntotal\nResident\nTotal\n59\n45\n85\n47\nIInd\nRenewal\n(3rd Batch)\n89\nIIIrd\nRenewal\n(4th Batch)\n97\nIVth\nRenewal\n(5th Batch) \n106\n47\n54\n62\nRecog-\nnition\n106\n62\n15.\nIt may be useful to advert to the Scheme dealing with\ngrant of permission as substituted in terms of Gazette\nNotification dated 08.02.2016. The same reads thus:-\n18\n“8. GRANT OF PERMISSION:\n(i) The Central Government, on the recommendation of the\nCouncil for Letter of Permission, may issue a letter to set up a\nnew medical college with such conditions or modifications in the\noriginal proposal as may be considered necessary. This letter\ncan also include a clear cut statement of preliminary\nrequirements to be met in respect of buildings, infrastructural\nfacilities, medical and allied equipments, faculty and staff\nbefore admitting the first batch of students. The formal\npermission may be granted after the above conditions and\nmodifications are accepted and performance bank guarantee for\nthe required sums are furnished by the person and after\nconsulting the Medical Council of India. \n(1) The formal permission may include a time bound programme\nfor the establishment of the medical college and expansion of\nthe hospital facilities.

Further admissions shall not be\nmade at any stage unless the requirements of the\nCouncil are fulfilled.

\nIn terms of Gazette Notification dated 18.03.2016 the following\nadditions/modifications/deletions/substitutions, shall be, as \nindicated therein:\n3.(1) In Clause 8(3)(1)(a) under the heading of

The Council shall,\n22\nthereafter, submit its report in the same manner as prescribed\nfor the initial report.”\nConsidering the requirements of the scheme and as the petitioner\ncollege failed to fulfil the conditions specified by the OC as\nincorporated in the formal conditional Letter of Permission dated\n12th September, 2016, the question of confirming the Letter of\nPermission for the academic session 2016-17 without removal of\ndeficiencies in all respects does not arise. The petitioner college\nmust first remove all those deficiencies to become eligible for\nconfirmation of LOP, as per the undertaking given by the college\nin that regard. \n16.\nThe petitioners have relied upon recent decisions of\nthis Court dealing with similar issues in the cases viz Dr.\nJagat Narain Subharti Charitable Trust & Anr. Vs.\nUnion of India and Ors. 2 ; Gangajali Education Society\n& Anr. Vs. Union of India & Ors.3; Saraswati\nEducational Charitable Trust & Anr. Vs. Union of India\n& Ors. 4; Apollo Institute of Medical Sciences &\nResearch & Ors. Vs. Union of India & Anr. 5, to contend\nthat in similar situations, this Court preferred to rely on the\n2\n3\n4\n5\n Writ Petition (C) No. 513 of 2017, decided on 30.08.2017.\n Writ Petition (C) No.709 of 2017, decided on 31.08.2017.\n Writ Petition (C) No. 515 of 2017, decided on 01.09.2017.\n Writ Petition (C) No. 496 of 2017, decided on 31.08.2017.\n23\nopinion given by the OC and overturned the conclusion\nreached by the Competent Authority of the Central\nGovernment for debarring the concerned institution from\nadmitting students for a period of two years and authorising\nMCI to encash bank guarantee of Rs.2 Crore. This\nsubmission does not commend us. For, the dictum in those\ncases is contextual and on facts of those cases. In the\npresent case, the Hearing Committee has duly considered\nthe explanation offered by the college. It has, however,\nrejected the same for the reasons recorded in the impugned\ndecision. The fact that specific reference to the opinion of\nthe OC is absent in the conclusion recorded by the Hearing\nCommittee, it does not follow that the issue has not been\nconsidered by the Hearing Committee or by the Central\nGovernment. The Competent Authority in the final decision\nafter adverting to the observations of the OC and also of the\nHearing Committee has noted that the absence of such\nlarge number of faculties and residents during duty hours\nwas unacceptable and, moreso, failure of the college to\nensure presence of 5 (five) residents on night off and yet\ncould not come, even late, for the head count nor was it\n24\nreflected in the SAF. This aspect has not been dealt with by\nthe OC in its opinion dated 14th May, 2017. Therefore,\nnon-acceptance of the explanation offered by the college by\nthe Hearing Committee and the Competent Authority of the\nCentral Government, cannot be said to be irrelevant, unjust\n \nor for extraneous consideration.\n17.\nAs stated earlier, the college had failed to produce\nsupportive documents or evidence about 6 (six) minor\noperations on the day of assessment. No doubt, the OC\naccepted the explanation of the college by holding that there\nwas no Minimum Standard Requirement (for short ‘MSR’) in\nthat behalf. The finding in the assessment report was that\nthere was only one minor operation on the day of\nassessment whereas the college claimed to have conducted\n6 (six) operations. Nothing prevented the college from\nproducing documents or evidence in support of that claim\nbefore the Hearing Committee. It was open to the\npetitioners to invite the attention of the Hearing Committee\nto such documents, if already placed on record during the\nearlier hearing. That was obviously not done. Else, the\nHearing Committee in its conclusion submitted to the\n25\nMinistry may have referred to it. The Hearing Committee\nhas noted that even the relevant list/documents in relation\nto paramedical non-teaching staff was not produced before\nit. There is no reason to doubt the correctness of this\nfactual position noted by the Hearing Committee. In any\ncase, since the deficiencies in respect of faculty (16.79%)\nand residents (21.73%) remains unexplained and being\nsignificant, the same cannot be overlooked. This appears to\nbe the view taken by the Hearing Committee and the\nCompetent Authority of the Central Government. \n18.\nBe that as it may, the opinion of the Hearing\nCommittee, which is the basis for passing the impugned\ndecision, is founded on the performance of the college on\nthe day of inspection dated 18th – 19th November, 2016. The\nquestion is: whether absence of faculty members and\nresidents on the given day, assuming it to be substantial in\nnumber, per se, could be the basis for determining the\nefficiency and performance of the college for the rest of the\nacademic session while considering the proposal for grant of\npermission? There is nothing in the opinion of the Hearing\nCommittee or the decision of the Competent Authority that\n26\nrequisite number of faculty members and residents was not\nemployed in the petitioner college or that the claim of the\npetitioner college in that behalf was bogus. The noting is\nabout the absence of such large number of faculty and\nresidents on the day of inspection and during the duty\nhours. Assuming that the college could not secure the\npresence of those persons at the time of inspection, it does\nnot follow that those faculty members and residents were\nnot on the pay roll and in the employment of the petitioner\ncollege. This aspect certainly requires proper verification\n \nand consideration by the concerned authority.\n19.\nA priori, we may adopt the course as in the case of\nWorld College of Medical Sciences & Research Vs.\nUnion of India6, by directing the respondents to allow the\nstudents already admitted in the petitioner college on the\nbasis of conditional LOP for the academic session 2016-17,\nto continue their studies. The MCI shall send its Inspection\nTeam within a period of three months to submit an\nassessment report regarding the overall performance and\nefficiency of the petitioner college and deficiencies, if any,\nand give time to the petitioner college to remove those\n6\n Writ Petition (C) No. 514 of 2017, decided on 05.09.2017.\n27\ndeficiencies within the time specified in that regard. The\npetitioner medical college shall then report its compliance\nand communicate the removal of deficiencies to MCI,\nwhereafter it will be open to the MCI to verify the position\nand then submit its recommendation to the Central\nGovernment. The Ministry shall take a final decision within\none month of the receipt of the recommendation from the\nMCI. Until such decision is taken and communicated to the\npetitioners, the Bank Guarantee offered by the petitioners\nin the sum of Rs. Two Crore shall not be encashed by the\nMCI but the petitioners shall keep the same alive. In the\nevent the final decision of the Competent Authority of the\nCentral Government is adverse to the petitioners, it will be\nopen to them to take recourse to such remedies as may be\navailable in law. \n20.\nBe it noted that the purpose of the stated inspection\nwould be to consider the confirmation of LOP in favour of\npetitioner college for the academic session 2016-2017. We\nfurther direct the respondents to treat the renewal\napplication submitted by the petitioner college for the\nacademic session 2017-18 as having been made for the\n28\nacademic session 2018-19 and process the same in\naccordance with law with promptitude. \n21.\nWrit petition is disposed of in the aforementioned\nterms. No order as to costs.\n ……………………………….CJI.\n (Dipak Misra)\n………………………………….J.\n (Amitava Roy)\n………………………………….J.\n (A.M. Khanwilkar)\nNew Delhi,\nDated: September 12, 2017. 29\n    Here is the chunked document:\n\n<para>\n1. The petitioners made an application for establishment of a new medical college at Banthra, Shahjahanpur, U.P., in the name and style of Varunarjun Medical College from academic session 2016-17 onwards, to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India. The Ministry forwarded that application to the Medical Council of India (for short “MCI”) for evaluation and making recommendations under Section 10A of the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956 (for short “the 1956 Act”). The MCI conducted an assessment of the petitioner college on 12th and 13th January, 2016. On the basis of the assessment report, the Executive Committee of MCI, in its meeting held on 30th January, 2016, decided to make negative recommendations, in view of a large number of deficiencies noticed in the assessment report. A formal communication in that behalf was sent to the Central Government by MCI vide letter dated 31st January, 2016. The Ministry then afforded an opportunity of hearing to the college before a Hearing Committee on 25th February, 2016. The Hearing Committee concurred with the recommendation of MCI and submitted its observations to the Ministry to disapprove the proposal. Later on, compliance verification assessment was done by MCI on 30th March, 2016, which report was duly considered by the Executive Committee of MCI in its meeting held on 13th May, 2016. Once again, MCI in its meeting held on 13th May, 2016 decided to give negative recommendations in view of the deficiencies noticed in the compliance verification assessment. That opinion was formally communicated by the MCI to the Ministry vide letter dated 14th May, 2016. The Ministry accepted the recommendation of MCI and disapproved the application for establishment of a new medical college for academic session 2016-17 vide letter dated 8th June, 2016.\n</para>\n<para>\n2. The Oversight Committee (for short “OC”) constituted by this Court, however, issued a directive to the Ministry to obtain fresh compliance from the college and forward it to MCI. Pursuant to the said directive, MCI submitted its compliance to the Ministry citing various reasons. However, the OC approved the scheme of establishment of a new medical college with annual intake of 150 students for the academic year 2016-17, on certain conditions. The Central Government, therefore, issued a formal approval-cum-Letter of Permission (for short “LOP”) on 12th September, 2016 incorporating the conditions imposed by the OC.\n</para>\n<para>\n3. As per the conditions noted in the said LOP, an assessment with regard to verification compliance submitted by the college was conducted by the MCI on 18th & 19th November, 2016. During the said verification, certain deficiencies were noticed which were mentioned in the assessment report. The assessment report was duly considered by the Executive Committee of MCI in its meeting held on 22nd December, 2016. In view of the deficiencies, MCI decided to send a negative recommendation to the Ministry. The deficiencies noticed were as follows:\n</para>\n<para>\n4. “i. Deficiency of faculty is 16.79% as detailed in the report. ii. Shortage of Residents was 21.73% as detailed in the report. iii. There was only 1 Minor Operation on day of assessment. iv. There was 1 normal Delivery & NIL Caesarean Section on day of assessment. v. ICUs: There was only 1 patient each in MICU & SICU and 2 patients each in ICCU & PICU/NICU on day of assessment. vi. Details of Paramedical & Non-teaching staff available in the Institute are not provided. vii. MRD: ICD X classification of diseases is not followed for indexing. viii. Central Library: It is not air-conditioned.”\n</para>\n<para>\n5. The decision of the MCI was formally communicated to the Ministry vide letter dated 26th December, 2016. After receipt of the recommendation from the MCI, the Ministry decided to afford a personal hearing to the college on 17th January, 2017 before the Director General of Health Services (DGHS). The Hearing Committee considered the oral and written submissions of the college, but was not satisfied with the explanation given by the petitioners for want of proper evidence. The Hearing Committee submitted its report to the Ministry, which in turn forwarded the same to the OC for guidance. The OC vide letter dated 14th May, 2017 conveyed its views to the Ministry as follows:\n</para>\n<para>\n6. “(i) Faculty: In the Standard Assessment Forms (SAF), Principal has mentioned that 4 faculty members had gone for exchange/withdrawal of money from the bank with permission of the Principal and 3 were on sanctioned leave. Considering this explanation, the deficiency would be 6.15%, which is within the acceptable limits. (ii) Residents:- In the SAF, Principal has mentioned that 5 Residents had gone for exchange/withdrawal of money from the bank with permission of the Principal and 3 were on sanctioned leave. Considering these residents, the deficiency would be 4.34%, which is within the acceptable limits.”\n</para>\n<para>\n7. The Ministry after considering the recommendation of the MCI, the report of the DGHS and the views received from the OC, finally chose to accept the recommendation of the MCI. The decision of the Ministry was communicated to the petitioner college vide letter dated 31st May, 2017, debarring the college from admitting students for two years i.e. 2017-18 & 2018-19, and also authorising the MCI to encash the bank guarantee.\n</para>\n<para>\n8. Feeling aggrieved by the said decision, the petitioners filed a writ petition before the Allahabad High Court, being WP (C) No.15302 of 2017 which was disposed of on 8th August, 2017 following the decision of this Court in the case of Glocal Medical College & Super Speciality Hospital and Research Centre Vs. Union of India and Anr., decided on 1st August, 2017.\n</para>\n<para>\n9. Pursuant to the aforementioned decision of the High Court, the Ministry granted a hearing to the petitioner college on 16th August, 2017. It appears that the Hearing Committee considered the record, oral and written submissions of the college also the fresh representation given by the college. The Hearing Committee then submitted its report to the Ministry. Relying on the said recommendation of the Hearing Committee, the Ministry vide order dated 19th August, 2017 reiterated its earlier decision dated 31st May, 2017, debarring the college from admitting students for a period of two years i.e. 2017-18 & 2018-19 and also, authorising MCI to encash the bank guarantee of Rs.2 Crore.\n</para>\n<para>\n10. Aggrieved, the petitioners have prayed for quashing of the said order and further, directing respondent No.1 (Union of India through Secretary, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare) to issue first renewal of Letter of Permission for admission of the 2nd batch of 150 MBBS students in the petitioner college for the academic session 2017-18 and also refrain from encashing the bank guarantee dated 15th September, 2017 offered by the petitioners in favour of MCI in the sum of Rs.2 Crore.\n</para>\n<para>\n11. According to the petitioners, they had placed all the relevant material before the Competent Authority of the Central Government, clearly indicating that the deficiencies noticed in the concerned assessment report were insignificant and within permissible limit. Our attention was invited to the communication sent by the MCI dated 26th December, 2016, highlighting the deficiencies noticed by the Council Assessors on 18th & 19th November, 2016. The petitioners have also relied on the explanation offered by the petitioners before the Hearing Committee as well as OC. It is contended that the explanation found favour with the OC.\n</para>\n<para>\n12. The Competent Authority of the Central Government has, however, completely disregarded the opinion of the OC. It was then contended that the recent report of the Hearing Committee does not take the matter any further. The relevant portion of the said report has been extracted in paragraph 17 of the impugned decision of the Ministry. On the one hand, the Hearing Committee observed that the explanation offered by the petitioner college regarding absence of faculty and residents was plausible, but it still chose to disregard that explanation on the specious ground that it was not proved. Further, no analysis as to why the opinion of the OC should be deviated is found in the observations of the Hearing Committee.\n</para>\n<para>\n13. It is contended that the absence of faculty and residents on the day of inspection ought to be excluded, in which case the deficiency of faculty would stand reduced to only 6.15% and of residents to only 4.34%. Further, the adverse observations noted by the Hearing Committee with regard to minor operations and paramedical non-teaching staff is not consistent with the record produced by the petitioner college during the hearing.\n</para>\n<para>\n14. It is submitted that in view of the recent pronouncements of this Court in respect of other institutions, similar relief be given to the petitioner institution. A comparative chart of the deficiencies in respect of the said institutions was produced before us to contend that in so far as the petitioner college is concerned, the deficiencies were marginal and relatively less.\n</para>\n<para>\n15. The main grievance of the petitioners is that despite clear directions given by the Court to consider the proposal of the petitioner college after taking into account the material produced and explanation offered by the petitioners, including the fresh representation, neither the Hearing Committee nor the Competent Authority of the Central Government has adverted to the explanation and material relied upon by the petitioners. Moreso, neither the Hearing Committee nor the Competent Authority of the Central Government has analysed the opinion of the OC which had accepted the explanation or recorded any reason to deviate from the same.\n</para>\n<para>\n16. It is, therefore, submitted that the impugned decision deserves to be quashed and set aside and further directions should be issued to the respondents to issue confirmation of Letter of Permission in favour of the petitioner college for the academic session 2016-17 and also allow the petitioner college to admit 150 students in the second batch of the MBBS course for the academic session 2017-18.\n</para>\n<para>\n17. Per contra, the respondents submit that the final decision of the Competent Authority of the Central Government is just and proper, in the fact situation of the present case. Inasmuch as the Hearing Committee did not accept the explanation offered by the petitioner regarding the deficiencies relating to faculty members and residents.\n</para>\n<para>\n18. The Hearing Committee was also not convinced with the explanation given by the petitioners about their claim of 6 (six) minor operations as the college had failed to produce supporting documents and evidence in that regard.\n</para>\n<para>\n19. Similarly, the college failed to produce material to substantiate that the college had paramedical non-teaching staff which was one of the essential requirements.\n</para>\n<para>\n20. Learned counsel for the respondents submitted that the recent decisions rendered by this Court on which reliance has been placed, were on the facts of the concerned case. Our attention was also invited to the relevant provisions of the Act, Regulations and Statutory Scheme formulated for consideration of application for permission to establish a medical college.\n</para>\n<para>\n21. It is submitted that the assessment done by the MCI in the present case was with regard to the verification of the compliance submitted by the college for considering the proposal for confirmation of conditional LOP granted to the petitioner college for the academic session 2016-2017.\n</para>\n<para>\n22. For that reason, the minimum standards regarding infrastructure and academic requirements as postulated in the Statutory Scheme must govern the consideration of the proposal.\n</para>\n<para>\n23. The benchmark regarding infrastructure and academics to be fulfilled by the applicant college for permission to establish medical college are pre-conditions.\n</para>\n<para>\n24. However, without fulfilment of those conditions, conditional LOP was granted to the petitioner college on the basis of direction issued by the OC, which was then acted upon by the Central Government by issuing a formal LOP for the academic session 2016-17 on conditions specified by the OC.\n</para>\n<para>\n25. The college has failed to fulfil those conditions as was noticed during the verification of compliance.\n</para>\n<para>\n26. It is submitted that no indulgence be shown to the petitioner college, much less, grant further relief claimed to allow the petitioner college to admit students in the second batch of the MBBS course for the academic session 2017-18.\n</para>\n<para>\n27. Heard Mr. Rajiv Dhavan, learned senior counsel along with Mr. Abdhesh Chaudhary, learned counsel for the petitioner, Mr. Maninder Singh, learned Additional Solicitor General for Union of India and Mr. Vikas Singh, learned senior counsel along with Mr. Gaurav Sharma, learned counsel for the Medical Council of India.\n</para>\n<para>\n28. We must first answer the submission of the petitioners that the satisfaction recorded by the OC whilst accepting the explanation offered by the petitioners was binding on the Central Government.\n</para>\n<para>\n29. We do not agree with this submission. It is one thing to say that the satisfaction/opinion recorded by the OC constituted by this Court is a relevant matter and which must receive due attention of the Hearing Committee as well as the Central Government.\n</para>\n<para>\n30. But it is not possible to accept the contention that the opinion of OC must bind the Hearing Committee and the Central Government whilst discharging their statutory duties, moreso, when the legislative scheme of the Act has bestowed the final authority upon the Central Government to grant or refuse to grant permission in terms of Section 10-A of the Act.\n</para>\n<para>\n31. Having said this, we may now advert to the deficiencies noticed in the assessment report regarding verification of compliance submitted by the college.\n</para>\n<para>\n32. The deficiencies noticed in the said report in respect of faculty members and residents were sought to be explained by the college - that 4 (four) faculty members and 5 (five) residents had gone for exchange/withdrawal of money from the bank with permission of the Principal and 3 (three) were on sanctioned leave.\n</para>\n<para>\n33. This explanation commended to the OC as plausible and on that basis, the OC was of the view that deficiency in respect of faculty members would stand reduced to the permissible limit.\n</para>\n<para>\n34. The Hearing Committee, however, observed that the petitioner college did not substantiate the stand so taken.\n</para>\n<para>\n35. Further, absence of such large number of faculties and residents during working-duty hours could not be countenanced.\n</para>\n<para>\n36. Additionally, the Hearing Committee was of the view that the college was not able to explain the absence of 5 (five) residents who were on night off and yet could not come, even late, for the head count.\n</para>\n<para>\n37. Besides, no entry to that effect was recorded in the Standard Assessment Forms (for short, “SAF”).\n</para>\n<para>\n38. The OC, however, has not commented on this aspect of the matter at all.\n</para>\n<para>\n39. In our opinion, the view taken by the Competent Authority of the Central Government is a possible view.\n</para>\n<para>\n40. The pre-conditions to maintain high academic standards for imparting MBBS course cannot be undermined.\n</para>\n<para>\n41. In this case, the deficiency of faculty and residents was significant, besides the other two deficiencies taken note of by the Hearing Committee and the Central Government in the impugned decision.\n</para>\n<para>\n42. For that, the college did not produce supportive documents or evidence in respect of its claim of 6 (six) minor operations and list of paramedical non-teaching staff.\n</para>\n<para>\n43. These deficiencies cannot be treated as trivial or unrelated to maintenance of high standards of imparting medical education.\n</para>\n<para>\n44. We are conscious of the fact that the proposal under consideration was for establishment of a new medical college from academic session 2016-17 and that has to be examined keeping in mind the norms specified in the statutory scheme formulated regarding permission to establish a new medical college.\n</para>\n<para>\n45. That scheme postulates the minimum standard of education, which has been formulated by the MCI in terms of Section 19-A of the Act.\n</para>\n<para>\n46. The scheme provides for minimum infrastructure facilities and staff requirements for 100 admissions.\n</para>\n<para>\n47. It also provides guidance as to how deficiency in respect of those matters should be calculated.\n</para>\n<para>\n48. The Medical Council of India has published those norms and the schemes for requirements to be fulfilled by the applicant College(s) for obtaining Letter of Intent and Letter of Permission for establishment of a new medical college and for yearly renewal under Section 10-A of the Act.\n</para>\n<para>\n49. Inter alia, it provides as follows:\n</para>\n<para>\n50. “Notes: For purpose of working out the deficiency: (1) The deficiency of teaching faculty and Resident Doctors shall be counted separately. (A) For Teaching Faculty: (a) For calculating the deficiency of faculty, Prof. Assoc Prof., Asst. Prof & Tutor in respective departments shall be counted together.”\n</para>\n<para>\n51. A priori, we may adopt the course as in the case of World College of Medical Sciences & Research Vs. Union of India by directing the respondents to allow the students already admitted in the petitioner college on the basis of conditional LOP for the academic session 2016-17, to continue their studies.\n</para>\n<para>\n52. The MCI shall send its Inspection Team within a period of three months to submit an assessment report regarding the overall performance and efficiency of the petitioner college and deficiencies, if any, and give time to the petitioner college to remove those deficiencies within the time specified in that regard.\n</para>\n<para>\n53. The petitioner medical college shall then report its compliance and communicate the removal of deficiencies to MCI, whereafter it will be open to the MCI to verify the position and then submit its recommendation to the Central Government.\n</para>\n<para>\n54. The Ministry shall take a final decision within one month of the receipt of the recommendation from the MCI.\n</para>\n<para>\n55. Until such decision is taken and communicated to the petitioners, the Bank Guarantee offered by the petitioners in the sum of Rs. Two Crore shall not be encashed by the MCI but the petitioners shall keep the same alive.\n</para>\n<para>\n56. In the event the final decision of the Competent Authority of the Central Government is adverse to the petitioners, it will be open to them to take recourse to such remedies as may be available in law.\n</para>\n<para>\n57. Be it noted that the purpose of the stated inspection would be to consider the confirmation of LOP in favour of petitioner college for the academic session 2016-2017.\n</para>\n<para>\n58. We further direct the respondents to treat the renewal application submitted by the petitioner college for the academic session 2017-18 as having been made for the academic session 2018-19 and process the same in accordance with law with promptitude.\n</para>\n<para>\n59.
